# IceLocatorDiscovery

IceLocatorDiscovery is an Ice plug-in that discovers IceGrid and custom locators on a network using UDP multicast. Once
installed, the plug-in automatically and transparently issues a multicast query in an attempt to find one or more
locators, collects the responses, and configures the Ice runtime accordingly.
