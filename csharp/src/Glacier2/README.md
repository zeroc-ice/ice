# Glacier2

The ZeroC.Glacier2 NuGet package allows Ice for C# applications to integrate with the [Glacier2] firewall transversal
service.

In a typical Glacier2 deployment, the client can establish a connection to the Glacier2 router but cannot establish a
connection to the server, because the server is on a separate network.
