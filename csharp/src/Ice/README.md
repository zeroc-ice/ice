# Ice

The Internet Communications Engine (Ice) is a complete RPC framework that helps you build networked applications with
minimal effort. [Ice] allows you to focus your efforts on your application logic, and it takes care of all interactions
with low-level network programming interfaces. With Ice, there is no need to worry about details such as opening network
connections, serializing and deserializing data for network transmission, or retrying failed connection attempts.

## Sample Code

```slice
// Slice contract

module VisitorCenter
{
    /// Represents a simple greeter.
    interface Greeter
    {
        /// Creates a personalized greeting.
        /// @param name The name of the person to greet.
        /// @return The greeting.
        ["cs:identifier:Greet"] // We prefer PascalCase for C# methods.
        string greet(string name);
    }
}
```

```csharp
// Client application

// Slice module VisitorCenter in Greeter.ice maps to C# namespace VisitorCenter.
using VisitorCenter;

// Create an Ice communicator. We'll use this communicator to create proxies and manage outgoing connections.
await using Ice.Communicator communicator = Ice.Util.initialize(ref args);

// GreeterPrx is a class generated by the Slice compiler. We create a proxy from a communicator and a "stringified
// proxy" with the address of the target object.
// If you run the server on a different computer, replace localhost in the string below with the server's hostname
// or IP address.
GreeterPrx greeter = GreeterPrxHelper.createProxy(communicator, "greeter:tcp -h localhost -p 4061");

// Send a request to the remote object and get the response.
string greeting = await greeter.GreetAsync(Environment.UserName);

Console.WriteLine(greeting);
```

```csharp
// Server application

// Create an Ice communicator. We'll use this communicator to create an object adapter.
await using Ice.Communicator communicator = Ice.Util.initialize(ref args);

// Create an object adapter that listens for incoming requests and dispatches them to servants.
Ice.ObjectAdapter adapter = communicator.createObjectAdapterWithEndpoints("GreeterAdapter", "tcp -p 4061");

// Register the Chatbot servant with the adapter.
adapter.add(new Server.Chatbot(), new Ice.Identity { name = "greeter" });

// Start dispatching requests.
adapter.activate();
Console.WriteLine("Listening on port 4061...");

// Shut down the communicator when the user presses Ctrl+C.
Console.CancelKeyPress += (sender, eventArgs) =>
{
    eventArgs.Cancel = true; // don't terminate the process
    Console.WriteLine("Caught Ctrl+C, shutting down...");
    communicator.shutdown(); // starts shutting down
};

// Wait until the communicator is shut down. Here, this occurs when the user presses Ctrl+C.
await communicator.shutdownCompleted;
