# IceBox

IceBox allows you to develop Ice servers as collections of services that can be dynamically loaded by the
[IceBox server] through configuration.

The ZeroC.IceBox NuGet package provides the IceBox assembly required to develop IceBox services. It also includes the
Slice definitions that define the `IceBox::ServiceManager` interface, used to remotely administer an IceBox server. The
generated code for these definitions is included in the IceBox assembly.
