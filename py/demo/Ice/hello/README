This demo illustrates how to invoke ordinary (twoway)
operations, as well as how to make oneway, datagram,
secure, and batched invocations.

To run the demo, first start the server:

$ python Server.py

In a separate window, start the client:

$ python Client.py

To test timeouts you can use 'T' to set a timeout on
the client proxy and 'P' to set a delayed response in
the server to cause a timeout.
