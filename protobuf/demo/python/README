Introduction
------------

This demo shows how to integrate Google Protocol Buffers with Ice.

The Protocol Buffers distribution and documentation can be found at

  http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/

This demo was tested with Protocol Buffers version 2.5.0.

Ice supports metadata that makes it possible for you to specify
Protocol Buffers message types in your Slice definitions, with Ice
handling the serialization chores for you automatically. The metadata,
which may only be used on a sequence<byte> type, has the following
syntax in Python:

  python:protobuf:protoc-generated-class

For example:

  ["python:protobuf:Person_pb2.Person"] sequence<byte> Person;

The type name specified in this example, Person_pb2.Person,
corresponds to the Python class generated by the Protocol Buffers
compiler (protoc) for the definition shown below:

  package tutorial;
  message Person { ... };

Prior to running the demo, you must generate the Python code for
Person.proto by running the following command:

  $ protoc --python_out=. Person.proto


Running the demo
----------------

First you must ensure that your environment is set up to run Ice
applications. Please see the documentation that came with your Ice
distribution for more information.

To run the demo, first start the server:

  $ python Server.py

In a separate window, start the client:

  $ python Client.py
