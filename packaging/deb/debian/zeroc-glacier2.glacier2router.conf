#
# The client-visible endpoint of Glacier2. This should be an endpoint
# visible from the public Internet, and it should be secure.
# IANA-registered TCP ports for the Glacier2 router:
# - 4063 (insecure)
# - 4064 (secure, using SSL)
#
# Using tcp is not recommended for production!
#
Glacier2.Client.Endpoints=tcp -p 4063 -h localhost
#Glacier2.Client.Endpoints=ssl -p 4064 -h localhost

#
# The server-visible endpoint of Glacier2. This endpoint is only
# required if callbacks are needed (leave empty otherwise). This
# should be an endpoint on an internal network (like 192.168.x.x), or
# on the loopback, so that the server is not directly accessible from
# the Internet.
#
Glacier2.Server.Endpoints=tcp -h localhost

#
# This permissions verifier allows any user-id / password combination;
# this is not recommended for production!
#
Glacier2.PermissionsVerifier=DemoGlacier2Router/NullPermissionsVerifier

#
# The timeout for inactive sessions. If any client session is inactive
# for longer than this value, the session expires and is removed. The
# unit is seconds.
#
Glacier2.SessionTimeout=30

#
# Glacier2 always disables active connection management so there is no
# need to configure this manually. Connection retry does not need to
# be disabled, as it's safe for Glacier2 to retry outgoing connections
# to servers. Retry for incoming connections from clients must be
# disabled in the clients.
