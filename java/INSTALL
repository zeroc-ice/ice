This distribution contains the Ice for Java source code, class files,
and HTML reference material. The following sections describe the
requirements for using Ice for Java and provide instructions for
installing it.


======================================================================
Requirements
======================================================================


Operating systems
-----------------

Ice for Java has been tested under Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, MacOS X,
AIX and Windows 2000/XP, but due to the portability of Java, it is
very likely that it will also work on other platforms for which a
suitable Java implementation is available.

Note, however, that you will need the Slice to Java translator (see
below). ZeroC provides translator binaries for supported platforms.
For other platforms, you will have to either port Ice for C++ (which
contains the Slice to Java translator), or you will have to translate
Slice to Java on a supported platform, and copy the resulting Java
files to your target platform.


Java version
------------

Ice for Java requires Java version 1.4.1 or later. Older versions are
not supported, because Ice makes use of the new java.nio packages.
(java.nio was introduced in version 1.4.0, but was broken on Windows.)

You can download the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition from
http://java.sun.com/j2se/.

Make sure to add javac and java to your PATH.

On HP-UX 11, we recommend using JDK 1.4.2.06 along with patch
PHNE_29887 to avoid the potential for hangs during shutdown. See the
link below for more information:

http://www.hp.com/products1/unix/java/java2/sdkrte14/downloads/index_pa-risc.html

With the Ice for Java SSL plugin, you may experience occasional hangs.
The most common reason is that  your system's entropy pool is empty. The 
work-around is to edit <java.home>/lib/security/java.security to use 
/dev/urandom instead of /dev/random.  


Slice to Java translator
------------------------

You will need the Slice to Java translator and supporting executables
and libraries. You can download a pre-compiled archive from our FTP
server, or you can build Ice for C++ yourself.

The pre-compiled archives are available for the supported platforms
from http://www.zeroc.com/download.html.


Other Ice utilities
-------------------

Some of the Ice for Java tests and demonstration programs require
additional Ice for C++ utilities, such as IcePack and Glacier. For
space reasons, the pre-compiled archives ZeroC supplies for Unix
platforms contain only the Slice-to-Java translator (slice2java),
the Slice-to-Freeze translator (slice2freezej), and the documentation
generator (slice2docbook). Therefore, not all Ice for Java tests can
be run without building Ice for C++ yourself.


Berkeley DB
-----------

Freeze for Java uses Berkeley DB as its underlying database. It requires
Berkeley DB 4.2.52.

Even though Berkeley DB is included with many Linux distributions, the 
Java files for Berkeley DB are usually not available. This means that
you must build Berkeley DB manually.

You can download Berkeley DB from:

http://www.sleepycat.com/download.html

When you build Berkeley DB, make sure to configure Berkeley DB with
Java support. For Linux, this is done by specifying --enable-java with
"configure". For Windows 2000/XP, you must select the "db_java --
Win32 Release" project. For details, please see:

http://www.sleepycat.com/docs/index.html

On AIX with Java 1.4.2, you also need the non-public "java-globalrefs"
patch for Berkeley DB 4.2.52.

Make sure to add db.jar to your CLASSPATH, and verify that the Berkeley
DB shared libraries are in your java.library.path. On Linux, this can
be achieved by adding <Berkeley DB home>/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
for example:

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/db4/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Note that the Ice for Java distribution is compiled against Berkeley
DB 4.2.52.


bzip2
-----

Ice for Java supports protocol compression using the bzip2 classes
included with Apache Ant (see "Compiling the Source" below).

Compression is automatically enabled if the classes are present in
the CLASSPATH. You can either add ant.jar to your CLASSPATH, or
download only the bzip2 classes from

http://www.kohsuke.org/bzip2/

Note that these classes are a pure Java implementation of the bzip2
algorithm and therefore add significant latency to Ice requests.


Python 2.2
----------

To run the automated test suite, you will need Python 2.2. If you have
no interest in running the test scripts, Python is not required.
Linux distributions usually include Python. For Windows 2000/XP, you
can download a Python distribution from:

http://www.activestate.com


======================================================================
Testing
======================================================================

You can run the Ice for Java test suite, provided that you have
installed Python:

python allTests.py

Note that on some Linux distributions (like Redhat 7.x), Python 2.2 is
available as "python2", in which case you must use:

python2 allTests.py

If everything worked out, you should see lots of "ok". In case of a
failure, the tests abort with "failed".

If you want to try out any of the demos, make sure to add lib/Ice.jar
to your CLASSPATH.


======================================================================
Compiling the Source
======================================================================

There is generally no need to compile Ice for Java, because this
distribution already contains the class files for the Ice core, Ice
services, examples and tests.

If you want to rebuild the source code, you will need the 'ant'
utility, version 1.6.2 or later, which is available here:

http://ant.apache.org/

You must also install ant's "optional tasks" (optional.jar) in the same
directory as ant.jar.

After installing ant, run the following commands to completely rebuild
the Ice for Java source code:

$ ant clean
$ ant

NOTE: If you use cygwin, be aware that ant 1.6.2 has a bug that
causes it to misinterpret CLASSPATH entries having forward slashes.
The workaround is to change your CLASSPATH to use backslashes, or
revert to ant 1.6.1.


======================================================================
Installation
======================================================================

No automatic installation for Ice for Java is supported. Simply copy
the Ice.jar file from the lib directory to the directory of your
choice, and then add Ice.jar to your CLASSPATH.


======================================================================
MacOS X Notes
======================================================================

On MacOS X, an Ice server may not correctly detect the closure of
client connections, which can lead to a hang during server shutdown.
This appears to be caused by a problem in the JVM implementation, but
we are still looking into this issue. Until we resolve this matter,
We recommend the use of timeouts in object adapter endpoints.
