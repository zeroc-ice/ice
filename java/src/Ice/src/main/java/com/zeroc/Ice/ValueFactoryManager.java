     * Add a value factory. Attempting to add a factory with an id for
     * which a factory is already registered throws AlreadyRegisteredException.
     *
     * When unmarshaling an Ice value, the Ice run time reads the
     * most-derived type id off the wire and attempts to create an
     * instance of the type using a factory. If no instance is created,
     * either because no factory was found, or because all factories
     * returned nil, the behavior of the Ice run time depends on the
     * format with which the value was marshaled:
     *
     * If the value uses the "sliced" format, Ice ascends the class
     * hierarchy until it finds a type that is recognized by a factory,
     * or it reaches the least-derived type. If no factory is found that
     * can create an instance, the run time throws NoValueFactoryException.
     *
     * If the value uses the "compact" format, Ice immediately raises
     * NoValueFactoryException.
     *
     * The following order is used to locate a factory for a type:
     *
     * <ol>
     *
     * <li>The Ice run-time looks for a factory registered
     * specifically for the type.</li>
     *
     * <li>If no instance has been created, the Ice run-time looks
     * for the default factory, which is registered with an empty type id.
     * </li>
     *
     * <li>If no instance has been created by any of the preceding
     * steps, the Ice run-time looks for a factory that may have been
     * statically generated by the language mapping for non-abstract classes.
     * </li>
     *
     * </ol>
     * @param factory The factory to add.
     * @param id The type id for which the factory can create instances, or
     * an empty string for the default factory.
