# Glacier can forward requests buffered or unbuffered. Unbuffered
# means a lower resource consumption, as buffering requires one
# additional thread per connected client or server. However, without
# buffering, messages cannot be batched and message overriding doesn't
# work either. Also, with unbuffered request forwarding, the caller
# thread blocks for twoway requests.

#
# To prevent Glacier2 from being flooded with requests from or to one
# particular client, Glacier2 can be configured to sleep for a certain
# period after all current requests for this client have been

# over. The unit is milliseconds.

# Glacier2 always disables active connection management so there is no
