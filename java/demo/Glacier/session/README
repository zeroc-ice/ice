To run this demo, open three terminal windows. In the first window,
start the server:

$ java Server

In the second window, run the Glacier starter:

$ glacierstarter --Ice.Config=config

In the third window, run the client:

$ java Client

These commands require the "Ice.jar" file and the local subdirectory
"classes" to be in your CLASSPATH.

You will be asked for a userid and a password. Any userid/password
combination with the password being the same as the userid will be
accepted (for example, userid="test" and password="test").

If no data is received from the client for a period of 60 seconds 
(this timeout is configurable) the glacier session will be terminated.
In order for more data to be sent it is required that a new session be
created by restarting the client and logging in again.
