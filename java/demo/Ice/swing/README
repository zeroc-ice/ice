This demo illustrates how to write a swing application which invokes
ordinary (twoway) operations, as well as how to make oneway, datagram,
secure, and batched invocations.

To run the demo, first start the hello server:

$ cd ../hello
$ java Server

In a separate window, start the swing client:

$ java Client
