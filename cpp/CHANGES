Changes since version 1.1.0
---------------------------

- Added Ice.UDP.RcvSize and Ice.UDP.SndSize properties. These properties
  control the size of the UDP receive and send buffers as well as controlling
  the maximum size of a datagram invocation. If a datagram exceeds the
  configured size, the Ice run time throws a DatagramLimitException. (Note that,
  on the receiving size, detection of this condition is dependent on the
  local UDP implementation -- some UDP implementations silently drop datagrams
  that are too large to fit into the receive buffer instead of reporting
  the error or delivering a truncated datagram.)

- Added Ice.Warn.Datagrams. This property prints a warning on the server
  side if a DatagramLimitException is thrown.

- Added Ice.MessageSizeMax property. This property controls the
  maximum message size accepted by the Ice protocol in kiloBytes. The
  default value is 1024 (1 MB).

- Fixed a number of incorrect property settings in the config files
  for the demos.

- Added new property: Ice.Trace.Slicing. When set to a value > 0,
  unknown exception and class types that are sliced emit a warning.

- Added destroyOnInterrupt() to the Application
  class. destroyOnInterrupt() is now the default behavior, because
  shutdownOnInterrupt() only shuts down the server side of an
  application, and therefore doesn't work with pure clients.

- ObjectAdapter::removeServantLocator() no longer exists.  The life
  cycle of servant locators that are registered with an object adapter
  ends when the adapter is destroyed.

- Changed Ice::ServantLocator::deactivate to be passed the category
  for which a servant locator is being deactivated.

- Added --noindex option to slice2docbook to suppress generation of
  index pages for pdf version of documentation.

- Changed the behavior of Freeze::Map::insert to match the insert
  behavior on associative containers in the C++ standard: if the
  element is already there, it is not updated.  Added Freeze::Map::put
  function, to insert or replace an element, like the old insert. This
  corresponds to the behavior of Berkeley DB's DB->put().

- Added saveObject() operation on Evictor, and savedObject() operation
  on PersistenceStrategy.  saveObject() saves a persistent object
  immediately. Once an operation has called saveObject(), the object
  is considered "clean": other updates by the same operation can only
  be reliably saved by another call to saveObject().

- Added a test to the Slice parser to complain if an operation on a
  local interface or class has an exception specification.

- Added a test to the property parsing code to print a warning on
  stderr if a property is not recognized. This prevents silly typos,
  such as "Ice.config=MyFile" (instead of "Ice.Config=MyFile") from
  slipping through undetected.

- Changed the mapping of the Slice byte type: ::Ice::Byte is now a
  typedef for unsigned char. (Previously, ::Ice::Byte was a typedef to
  char.) This change guarantees that byte values are always in the
  range 0..255 (instead of either -128..127 or 0..255, depending on
  the CPU architecture). This change also permits function overloading
  for ::Ice::Byte and char (which can be useful if you use both
  strings and byte sequences).

- Fixed a performance problem in Glacier which would occur when using
  message batching.

- Portability fix in src/IceSSL/OpenSSLPluginI.cpp.

- config/Make.rules now checks that mkshlib is defined.

- src/IceUtil/CtrlCHandler.cpp now handles (ignores) EINTR returned by
  sigwait.

- Added DB_PRIVATE flag to DBEnv->open() on Linux, to be able to use
  the Berkeley DB that ships with RedHat 9.

- Changed the python code for printing output from test clients, so
  that you get each line as it comes.

- Fixed a bug where daemonized Ice::Application wouldn't shutdown
  properly.

- Added support for user defined variables in IcePack service and
  server descriptors.

- Fixed server side bug with batch oneways or batch datagrams.

Changes since version 1.0.1
---------------------------

- Added support for Visual Studio .NET 2003 aka VC 7.1

- In IceUtil, all "try" and "timed" functions now return false when
  the resource could not be acquired (i.e., an expected failure). The
  "Try" from "timedTry" functions was removed, and for consistency the
  functions trylock, readlock and writelock were renamed to tryLock,
  readLock and writeLock.

- Update to the library versioning scheme:

  On Windows, only the major and minor version are now used, for
  example: ice11d.dll (11d means 1.1 debug). In 1.0.x, the patch level
  was included in the version string, for example ice101d.dll.

  On Unix, the internal name (soname) is now constructed as
  lib<name>.so.<major version><minor version>, for example
  libIce.so.11 (for Ice 1.1.x). This internal name identifies a
  symbolic link to lib<name>.so.<full version>, for example:
  libIce.so.11 -> libIce.so.1.1.0. In 1.0.x, the internal name was set
  to the actual shared library file name, lib<name>.so.<full version>.

- Ice now implements slicing for exceptions and classes: if a process
  receives an exception or class that is of a more derived type than
  the receiver understands, the exception or class is automatically
  sliced. (Previously, this situation resulted in an exception.)

- Class factories are no longer necessary for non-abstract classes
  (that is, for classes that do not have operations). For non-abstract
  classes, the necessary factories are automatically installed by the
  Ice run time. If you have existing code that implements factories
  for non-abstract classes, you can simply delete that code.  Note
  that for abstract classes (that is, classes with operations), it is
  necessary to install a factory for each abstract class, exactly as
  in version 1.0.x.

- User exception factories and user exception factory managers no
  longer exist. The factories for user exceptions are now
  automatically installed by the Ice run time. If you have existing
  code that implements user exception factories, you can simply delete
  it.

- Fixed a bug in the Slice parser: the semantic check to see whether
  an identifier introduced into a scope has changed meaning was too
  stringent.

- If a client receives a derived exception for which it does not have
  a user exception factory installed, the client receives the
  exception sliced to a known base exception. In 1.0.x, the client
  would have received NoUserExceptionFactoryException, an exception
  that no longer exists in 1.1.x.

- Fixed a bug with connections being closed even though they have
  outstanding batch requests.

- Fixed bug in the WIN32 icepatch client. The removal of orphaned
  files didn't take into account that WIN32 file names are not case
  sensitive.

- New Ice.Nohup property: when its value is >0, shutdownOnInterrupt()
  in Application will ignore SIGHUP on Unix and CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT on
  Windows.

- Updated Application class: 

  * The default behavior is now shutdownOnInterrupt().

  * Removed the member function defaultInterrupt().
 
- Removed Communicator::signalShutdown(): Ice is not using signal
  handlers anymore, so Communicator::shutdown() can be used all the
  time.

- Added IceUtil::CtrlCHandler: a class that provides portable handling
  of CTRL+C and CTRL+C-like signals,

- Added IceUtil::StaticMutex, for simple, non-recursive, statically
  allocated and initialized mutexes.

- Updated Mutex, RecMutex and RWRecMutex APIs: lock and unlock now
  return void, and trylock returns a bool that indicates whether the
  mutex was acquired or not. Also added new member functions to LockT,
  TryLockT, RLockT, TryLockT, WLockT, TryWLockT: acquire(),
  tryAcquire(), release(), acquired() and more.

- Removed dependency on E2FSPROGS for UUID generation. On Unix, UUIDs
  are now generated directly with /dev/urandom.

- Added support for `env' XML element in IcePack descriptors to allow
  setting environment variables.

- Fixed a bug in the Slice parser: the semantic check to see whether
  an identifier introduced into a scope has changed meaning was too
  stringent.

- Fixed integer parsing bugs in the C++ XML stream class.

- Changed glacier router to send all requests from a separate
  thread. Previously, only requests forwarded as batch would be sent
  from a separate thread.

- Added support for SPARC/Solaris with the Sun C++ 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5
  compilers (32 and 64 bit). See INSTALL.SOLARIS for details.

- Replaced the Freeze::EvictorPersistenceMode enumeration with the
  interface Freeze::PersistenceStrategy.

- Added support for GCC 2.95.3.

- Several incompatible IceStorm changes:

  * Moved the subscribe and unsubscribe operations to the Topic
    interface.

  * Added an object adapter to host publisher objects, and hence a new
    configuration property IceStorm.Publish.Endpoints.

- Added dynamic thread pools, i.e., thread pools that grow and shrink
  based on a calculated load factor. Please see the section about
  thread pools in the manual for further details.

- Structs and sequences which hold other structs or sequences are now
  legal dictionary key types, as long as such nested structs or
  sequences are (recursively) legal.

- The connection timeout is now also used when connections are
  closed. This avoid hanging processes if the peer misbehaves, or if
  asynchronous methods invocations don't return.

- In some cases, communicator destruction could result in a
  NullHandleException. This has been fixed. Now a
  CommunicatorDestroyedException is raised.

- A monitor now holds the mutex lock while signaling a condition
  variable. Otherwise it's possible that the condition variable is
  destroyed before the signaling call returns, resulting in undefined
  behavior. The performance difference is minimal, hardly measurable.

- Further performance improvements with respect to latency.

- Added demo/Ice/throughput, which can be used to measure the transfer
  time of large sequences.

- Fixed a bug in the slice2cpp code generator: if a class was forward
  declared and used as a class member, but the definition of the class
  was not supplied in the same Slice compilation unit, invalid code
  was generated.

- Inlined most operators in IceUtil::Time for performance reasons.

- Added IceUtil::ThreadControl::isAlive(). This function is useful for
  implementing a non-blocking join().

- Added IceUtil::ThreadControl::id() member function.

- The scope of IceUtil::Thread::ThreadId has been changed to
  IceUtil::ThreadId. This is the type returned by both Thread::id()
  and ThreadControl::id().

- Joining with a thread more than once, joining with a detached
  thread, or detaching a detached thread now have undefined
  behavior. (Previously, doing any of these things raised an
  exception.)

- Added timestamps to the default Ice logger. You can enable
  timestamps by setting the `Ice.Logger.Timestamp' property to a value
  larger than zero. By default timestamps are disabled.

- Added several conversion functions to IceUtil::Time: toString,
  toSeconds, toMilliSeconds, toMicroSeconds.

- Fixed a bug in Freeze::DBEnvironment which caused the sync method to
  hang.

- Improved IceBox service deactivation. Instead of successively
  stopping a service and destroying its communicator, services are now
  all stopped first and then their communicators are destroyed.

- Modified the Ice protocol to marshal sizes more efficiently.  Sizes
  less than 255 now require a single byte whereas previously, sizes
  between 127 and 254 required five bytes.

- Modified the Ice protocol to fix a problem with compression. The
  compressed message types have been removed, and a field has been
  added to the message header indicating compression status.

- Added version negotiation to the Ice protocol. This permits future
  protocol extensions to be added without breaking interoperability
  with older deployed clients and servers. Unfortunately, doing this
  broke compatibility with the existing protocol so, when upgrading to
  this version, you must make sure that clients and servers use the
  same version of libIce.so.

- Added a magic number to the Ice protocol. All Ice protocol messages
  have 'I', 'c', 'e', 'P' (encoded as ASCII) in the first four bytes.
  This is useful to allow protocol analyzers to recognize Ice
  messages.

- Changed the encoding of encapsulations. An encapsulation now looks
  like:

	size (4 bytes)
	major version number (1 byte)
	minor version number (1 byte)
	data (n bytes)

  The size includes the count of bytes for the size and versions, so
  the value of size is n + 6.

- Added -v and -e options to stringified UDP endpoints. -v sets the
  protocol version and -e sets the encoding version. (The current
  version for both protocol and encoding is 1.0.)

- Compatibility fixes for GCC 2.96.

- Added `option' and `vm-option' elements to IcePack server
  descriptors. These elements are used to pass command line options to
  server processes.

- Added scandir() and alphasort() for Sun-OS and other Unix systems
  that do not have these BSD calls.

Changes since version 1.0.0
---------------------------

- Added --header-ext and --source-ext command-line options to
  slice2cpp and slice2freeze. These permit setting header and
  source file extensions for C++ other than the default `h' and
  `cpp' file extensions.

- Added the macro ICE_INT64 as a portable wrapper for long long
  constants.

- Added support for Xerces 2.2.0.

- Added support for OpenSSL 0.97a.

- Added OPENSSL_FLAGS to several Makefiles that were missing it.

- Changed signature of IceUtil::Time::milliSeconds() to
  IceUtil::Int64, to avoid overflows.

- Renamed Lock and TryLock templates to LockT and TryLockT, to avoid
  compilation problems with Sun Forte 6.2.

- Fixed a bug with throwing exceptions in AMD calls after invoking
  ice_response().

- Fixed a bug with throwing exceptions in AMI from within
  ice_response().

- For posix threads, PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE_NP is now only used if
  __linux__ is defined. Otherwise, PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE is used.

- The EPROTO error code is now only used if it is defined (such as
  on Linux).

- Several other changes that make Ice for C++ more portable.

- Updated SSL test certificates. The old ones have expired.
