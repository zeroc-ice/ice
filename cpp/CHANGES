      in the top-level directory.


Changes since version 3.2.0
---------------------------

- Added demo book/lifecycle.

- Added two new IceGrid properties:

    IceGrid.Registry.SessionFilters
    IceGrid.Registry.AdminSessionFilters 

  These properties allow disabling the setup of Glacier2 filters for
  IceGrid client and administrative sessions created through
  Glacier2. See the Ice manual for more information.

- Fixed object adapter activation deadlock. The deadlock could occur
  when the adapter register its endpoints with the locator registry
  and if another thread invokes concurrently on the locator.
  
- If the glacier2router can not contact the permissions verifier or
  session manager on startup it now prints a warning and continues
  rather than exiting. These warnings are disabled if the router is
  started with the --nowarn command line option.

- Added support for protected class data members using the new
  metadata tag ["protected"]. The tag can be applied to a Slice class
  or to individual data members.

- IceGrid now allows you to define an object adapter with a replica
  group from a different IceGrid application.

- Changed the throughput demo to better support cross-language
  testing.

- Fixed a bug in IceUtil::Cond under Windows that could cause a
  deadlock if a signal was used in conjunction with multiple waiting
  threads where at least one thread is using timedWait. Note that this
  bug also affects IceUtil::Monitor since this uses IceUtil::Cond.

- Fixed throughput performance problem on Windows that would occur
  when sending large requests.

- Added Ice.TCP.RcvSize and Ice.TCP.SndSize properties. These
  properties control the size of the TCP receive and send buffers for
  the TCP and SSL transports.

- Added support for opaque endpoints. For example:

  opaque -t 2 -v CTEyNy4wLjAuMREnAAD/////AA==

  This is the same as:

  ssl -h 127.0.0.1 -p 10001

  The "opaque" protocol identifier indicates an unknown protocol.
  Both the -t and the -v option must be present:

  -t <num>:    Indicates the protocol type (TCP = 1, SSL = 2, UDP = 3).

  -v <base64>: Provides the value of the opaque endpoint. The option
               argument is the marshaled representation of the endpoint
               (including the endpoint's enclosing encapsulation) in
               base64 encoding.

  This syntax is useful if, for example, a client that has the SSL
  plug-in configured sends a proxy with an SSL endpoint to a server
  without the SSL plug-in. Prior to this version, the server would
  drop the unknown SSL endpoint when it stringified the proxy.
  As of this version, the server preserves the endpoint and, when the server
  stringifies a proxy containing an unknown endpoint, it uses the above opaque syntax.

- Trailing characters past the adapter id in a stringified proxy
  will now raise a ProxyParseException.

- Fixed IceGrid registry assert which would be triggered on registration
  of duplicate well-known objects with the same object adapter.

- Added code generated from FileParser.ice to the IceGrid library.

- Fixed collocation optimization to also work for indirect proxies
  referring to a replica group.

- The findAllReplicas() operation in the IceGrid::Query interface now
  accepts well-known proxies from a replica group. This allows you to
  retrieve the replicas of a replicated object using its well-known
  proxy.

Changes since version 3.2b
--------------------------

- The icegridadmin command line utility now tries to connect to a
  slave registry if the master is not available.

Changes since version 3.1.1
---------------------------

- Deprecated Ice.UseEventLog. Windows services should no longer use
  this property! Also fixed a bug with the windows event logger which
  would cause hangs if the event log became full.

- Under Windows Ice Services (Ice::Service) always use the windows
  event logger unless initData is otherwise configured. Installing the
  service will now create the appropriate registry keys, and uninstalling
  the service will remove them.

- createObjectAdapter() and propertyToProxy() print warnings if
  unknown properties are found during creation of the adapter or
  proxy. These warnings can be disabled by setting the property
  Ice.Warn.UnknownProperties=0.

- Fixed a race condition that could cause an assertion failure when
  using thread-per-connection.

- Added the property Ice.Default.EndpointSelection. If not defined,
  the default value is "Random".

- Proxies and object adapters can now be configured to use
  thread-per-connection.

- IceBox services no longer inherit the properties of the container
  by default. If this is the desired behavior set the property
  IceBox.InheritProperties to 1.

- Fixed a bug where new connections are being accepted but not
  serviced correctly when using the thread pool concurrency model if
  the number of file descriptors registered with the thread pool
  exceeds FD_SETSIZE.

- Added Communicator::isShutdown() and ObjectAdapter::isDeactivated()
  to allow applications to determine whether a communicator has been
  shutdown or an object adapter has been deactivated, respectively.

- The Glacier2 SessionControl object is now registered with the Server
  adapter rather than the Admin adapter.

- Added "null" permissions verifier objects to Glacier2.

- Renamed the property Glacier2.AddUserToAllowCategories to
  Glacier2.Filter.Category.AcceptUser. The old property name has been
  deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

- Added destroy() operation to the ObjectAdapter interface. This
  operation must be called in order to reclaim the adapter's resources
  and be able to recreate a new adapter with the same name. Destroying
  a communicator automatically calls destroy on all of its adapters.

- Added a per-process logger and two methods to get/set the logger,
  Ice::getProcessLogger() and Ice::setProcessLogger(). Calling
  getProcessLogger() creates a default logger if setProcessLogger()
  has not been called. The process logger is also used as the default
  logger for all communicators that do not have a logger explicitly
  set.

- Added the property Glacier2.ReturnClientProxy to control whether
  Glacier2's implementation of the Router::getClientProxy() operation
  returns a proxy or just null. By default this property is set to 0.
  For backward compatibility with clients that use Ice versions older
  than 3.2, this property must be set to 1.

- Added support for a user-defined signal handler in Ice::Application.
  A subclass must override the interruptCallback method and invoke
  callbackOnInterrupt to activate it.

- Message batches are now automatically flushed when the total size of
  the batch reaches the message size maximum. This feature can be
  controlled using the Ice.BatchAutoFlush property, which is on by
  default.

- It is now possible to identify log files for IceGrid servers using
  the `log' XML element of a server descriptor. Server logs can be
  viewed remotely by the IceGrid GUI or the icegridadmin command-
  line utility.

- Added support to the IceGrid GUI and icegridadmin command-line
  utility for viewing the standard error and standard output files
  of an IceGrid node, registry, and server.

- Added new `property' attribute to IceGrid object descriptors. If
  this attribute is specified, the registry generates a property
  that supplies the object's identity. For example:

     <object id="hello" property="Identity"/>
  
  generates the property "Identity=hello".

- Patching a distribution with IceGrid should no longer result in an
  Ice::TimeoutException exception if the patching takes a long time.

- Fixed IceGrid to no longer return Ice::NoEndpointException to a
  client if the object adapter of a server managed by an IceGrid node
  is being deactivated. IceGrid will now queue the locate request from
  the client, reactivate the server and send the response of the
  locate request when the object adapter is active again.

- Replaced the IceGrid `wait-for-activation' attribute of an adapter
  descriptor with a new `server-lifetime' attribute. An adapter with
  the `server-lifetime' attribute set to true is expected to be active
  for the duration of the server execution. IceGrid considers a server
  active when all the adapters with this attribute set to true are
  active and considers that a server is being deactivated as soon as
  at least one such adapter is deactivated.

- Added findAllReplicas() method to the IceGrid::Query interface. This
  operation allows you to retrieve all the replicas associated with a
  given proxy.

- Added support for service property sets in server instances. These
  property sets allow you to specify additional properties for IceBox
  services hosted by IceBox server template instances. For example:
   
    <server-instance template="MyIceBoxTemplate">
      <properties service="MyService">
        <property name="Dummy" value="Dummy"/>
      </properties>
    </server-instance>

- Added new IceGrid `Ordered' load balancing policy. The endpoints of
  a replica group configured with this load balancing policy are
  ordered by the priority of each replica. A replica's priority is set
  with the new object adapter `priority' attribute.

- Removed the `None' load balancing policy from IceGrid. This load
  balancing policy is equivalent to the `Random' policy configured to
  return the endpoints of all the replicas (i.e., with the
  `n-replicas' attribute set to 0).

- Setting the n-replicas attribute of an IceGrid replica group load
  balancing policy to 0 is no longer equivalent to 1. It now causes
  the locator to return the endpoints of all the replicas that are
  members of the replica group.

- The IceGrid registry now supports replication in a master/slave
  scheme. See the Ice manual for information on the configuration
  of replicated IceGrid registries.

- During the creation of an object adapter, the communicator now
  raises InitializationException if the adapter has no configuration.
  It is possible to create an adapter with no configuration, which
  is useful for bidirectional connections, by passing an empty string
  as the argument to createObjectAdapter.

- It is now possible to start and stop individual IceBox services
  using the IceBox admin utility.

- Added Communicator::propertyToProxy() which creates a proxy from
  a set of properties. This operation allows you to set various local
  proxy settings, such as the locator cache timeout, which cannot be
  set using stringToProxy().

- Added ["cpp:class"] C++ metadata to map a slice struct to a
  reference counted class.

- Glacier2.AllowCategories is now deprecated and superseded by
  Glacier2.Filter.Category.Accept.

- The Ice.Logger.Timestamp property has been removed. Timestamps are
  now always printed.

- Added the property Ice.Default.PreferSecure, which if set to 1
  causes secure endpoints to be preferred over non-secure endpoints.
  By default this property is set to 0. Also added functions to
  control this behavior on a per-proxy rather than global basis:
  ice_isPreferSecure() and ice_preferSecure().

- Added a demo to illustrate the use of AMI/AMD.

- IceBox services are now stopped in the reverse order from which they 
  were started.

- If a proxy does not specify a hostname (via -h HOST), the client
  only attempts to connect to the loopback interface (127.0.0.1).

- All Ice exceptions now derive from std::exception.

- Attempts to change the attributes of a fixed proxy now result in a
  FixedProxyException rather than just ignoring the change request and
  returning the same proxy. Also, attempts to marshal a fixed proxy
  now result in a FixedProxyException rather than a MarshalException.

- Fixed a bug in the IceGrid locator implementation that could cause
  a memory corruption when using replica groups.

- Added support for implicit request contexts. When you invoke an
  operation on a proxy and don't pass an explicit context, Ice uses
  the "implicit context" combined with the per-proxy context (if any).
  You can obtain the implicit context using the new communicator
  operation getImplicitContext(). Three implementations of implicit
  context are available; you select one by setting the property
  Ice.ImplicitContext to one of the following values:

  * None: No implicit context at all (default).
  * PerThread: The implementation maintains a context per thread.
  * Shared: The implementation maintains a single thread-safe context
    that is shared by all threads.

- Removed defaultContext from InitializationData.

- Communicator::setDefaultContext(), Communicator::getDefaultContext()
  and Proxy::ice_defaultContext() have been deprecated.

- Ice now uses the epoll() system call on Linux and the poll() system
  call on other Unix platforms instead of select().

- Setting the IceGrid.Node.Name property is now required; this
  property no longer uses the hostname as its default value.

- For object adapters without endpoints, Ice.Trace.Network >= 2 now
  prints a trace message.

- Added new overload of Ice::initialize() that accepts a StringSeq as
  the first argument.

- IceStorm changes:

  Changed IceStorm federation such that IceStorm now detects when
  a downstream topic is unavailable. Once a link is diagnosed as
  non-functional, events are thrown out until a timer expires
  (specified using the property IceStorm.Discard.Interval in seconds,
  default value is 1 minute). At that point, delivery of the link
  is attempted once again.

  Added a new property IceStorm.Send.Timeout. This specifies a timeout
  in milliseconds that is used for all link and subscriber proxies.
  The default value is 1 minute.

  All message sending is now faster. In particular, oneway QoS is now
  significantly faster.

  All message propagation is now fully buffered through a dynamic
  thread pool. Tracing for the thread pool can be enabled using the
  property IceStorm.Trace.SubscriberPool. The thread pool size is
  controlled by the following properties.

  * IceStorm.SubscriberPool.Size: The initial size of the thread
    pool. The default value is 1.
  * IceStorm.SubscriberPool.SizeMax: The maximum size of the thread
    pool. The default value is 0, which means unlimited.
  * IceStorm.SubscriberPool.SizeWarn: A warning is issued if the size
    of the thread pool exceeds this value. The default is 0, which
    means never warn.
  * IceStorm.SubscriberPool.Timeout: Specifies a timeout in
    milliseconds. IceStorm spawns a new thread, up to the maximum
    size of the thread pool, if a stall is detected for longer than
    this timeout value. The default value is one second.

  It is now possible to call unlink with a topic proxy that refers
  to an IceStorm topic that is not currently reachable.

  Added per-subscriber publisher objects to IceStorm. The new
  operation Topic::subscribeAndGetPublisher returns a proxy that is
  used to send an event to only that particular subscriber. See
  demo/IceStorm/counter for an example of this feature.

  The legal values for the reliability QoS passed to the operation
  subscribeAndGetPublisher() are different than that of subscribe().
  The new operation accepts only "ordered" or an empty string and
  derives the desired QoS from the mode of the subscriber's proxy.
  For example, passing a subscriber proxy configured for oneway
  invocations enables oneway delivery in IceStorm. The "ordered" QoS
  requires a twoway proxy otherwise a BadQoS exception is raised.
  Topic::subscribe has been deprecated and retains the old QoS
  semantics.

  The property IceStorm.InstanceName is now used to produce unique
  identities for each IceStorm topic. The identities used are now:

    <instance-name>/topic.<topic name>
    <instance-name>/publisher.<topic name>
    <instance-name>/link.<topic name>

  IceStorm is still fully compatible with prior releases.

  The IceStorm database format was changed to accommodate the new
  identity semantics. The script config/upgradeicestorm.py can be
  used to upgrade existing IceStorm databases to the new format.

- Changes in icestormadmin:

  Removed support for the "graph" command.

  The various icestormadmin commands take the topic manager as an
  optional part of the arguments. For example, the command
  "create MyTopicManager/foo" creates the topic "foo" on the topic
  manager using the instance name MyTopicManager. See the Ice manual
  for more information.

  The program obtains the proxy for a topic manager using a property
  of the form IceStormAdmin.TopicManager.NAME. If an icestormadmin
  command does not specify a topic manager, the program uses the
  proxy in the property IceStormAdmin.TopicManager.Default. For
  backward compatibility, the property IceStorm.TopicManager.Proxy
  also sets the default topic manager.

  Added a new command "current" to set the default topic manager.

  The list command now takes the topic manager as the first argument,
  and the topics are the remaining arguments.

- Added Ice.Override.Secure which forces a client to only use
  secure connections.

- IceGrid registry now cleans up any existing administrative and
  regular client sessions that do not correctly time out. This could
  occur if the Glacier2 router terminates unexpectedly.

- Added Glacier2::SessionControl::getSessionTimeout.

- Fixed a bug in slice2cpp so that the #include statements in a
  generated header file are correctly modified by -I options.

- The icegridadmin command tool now must establish an administrative
  session with the IceGrid registry -- anonymous administration is no
  longer permitted. As with the IceGrid GUI, authentication occurs
  through the IceGrid Client endpoints either using a username and
  password or through SSL. See the Ice manual for full details.

- The IceGrid registry Admin endpoints have been removed. A new set of
  endpoints has been added for the Glacier2 session manager. These
  should only be enabled if Glacier2 integration is desired since it
  presents a security threat. The endpoints are defined by the
  property IceGrid.Registry.SessionManager.Endpoints.

- The ice_name() member function of exceptions derived from
  Ice::Exception (and, hence, IceUtil::Exception) now returns a
  non-const string instead of a const string:

  	const ::std::string ice_name() const; // Old signature

	::std::string ice_name() const; // New signature

- Changed IceUtil::Options to allow testing for synonyms without
  having to check both the short and long options. For example:

    IceUtil::Options opts;
    opts.addOpt("v", "version");
    opts.parse();

  Previously, to test whether the -v or --version option was set, you
  had to write:

    if(opts.isSet("v" || opts.isSet("version"))
	// show version...

  With the new behavior, you can test for either "v" or "version",
  and the test returns true if either the long or short option
  was set:

    if(opts.isSet("version"))
	// show version...

  or:

    if(opts.isSet("v"))
	// show version...

  Either test works correctly, regardless of whether the actual option
  passed to the executable was -v or --version.

  Note that, for this to work, you must add both long and short option
  in a single call to addOpt():

    opts.addOpt("v", "version"); // -v and --version are synonyms

  If you add the options in separate calls, they are not recognized
  as synonyms:

    opts.addOpt("v");		// --version is considered a separate
				// option from --version
    opts.addOpt("", "version"); // --version is considered a separate
				// option from -v

- The exceptions raised by IceUtil::Options have changed:

  - IceUtil::Options::APIError is now IceUtil::APIException

  - IceUtil::Options::BadOpt is now IceUtil::BadOptException

  - IceUtil::Options::BadQuote has been removed.

  APIException and BadOptException are now derived from
  IceUtil::Exception. IceUtil::Options::parse() and
  IceUtil::Options::split() now raise BadOptException (instead of
  BadQuote) if a closing quote is missing from a command-line
  argument.

- Added zero-copy functions to the stream classes.

- Added the NullSSLPermissionsVerifier to the IceGrid registry.

- Added more tracing to the IceSSL plug-in to aid in using the
  TrustOnly properties.

- Added --ip and --dns command line options to the iceca sign command.
  This adds support for subjectAltName in certificates.

- Merged the simple CA scripts into a single iceca script.

- Removed support for the following configuration properties that were
  deprecated in Ice 3.0:

  IceBox.ServiceManager.Identity
  IcePatch2.AdminIdentity
  IcePatch2.Identity
  Glacier2.AdminIdentity
  Glacier2.RouterIdentity

  Each of these services supports an InstanceName property that should
  be used instead.

- Added UnexpectedObjectException. This exception is raised if you
  use Slice classes and client and server are compiled with mismatched
  Slice definitions. Alternatively, this exception is raised if you
  use dynamic invocation and pass a class of the wrong type as an
  operation parameter.

- The Slice keyword 'nonmutating' is now deprecated; 'idempotent'
  should be used instead. A new metadata directive is supported for
  backward-compatibility (see below).

- Added the Freeze property Freeze.Evictor.UseNonmutating.

  When set to a non-zero value, the Freeze Evictor behaves like it did
  in previous Ice releases in that it assumes nonmutating operations
  do not update the target object, while all other operations do
  update the target.

  As of this release, the recommended mechanism is to use the
  "freeze:read" and "freeze:write" metadata (see below).

  If not defined, the default value of this property is 0.

- New Slice metadata for operations:

  - ["cpp:const"] generates a const member function on the
    corresponding servant base class.

  - ["freeze:read"] or ["freeze:write"] marks the operation as "read"
    or "write" for the Freeze evictor. The default is the Freeze mode
    of the enclosing interface/class.

  - ["nonmutating"] provides backward compatibility for idempotent
    operations that were previously declared using the deprecated
    'nonmutating' keyword. You can replace the 'nonmutating' keyword
    with '["nonmutating"] idempotent' to maintain compatibility with
    objects implemented using Ice 3.0 or 3.1.

- New Slice metadata for interfaces/classes:

  - ["freeze:read"] or ["freeze:write"] defines the default Freeze
    mode for operations on the interface/class. The default is read.
    This metadata has no effect on derived types.

- For non-abstract Slice classes, the C++ code generator now adds a
  protected destructor. This prevents accidental allocation of
  class instances on the stack or as static variables. For the
  implementation of abstract Slice classes, and for servant classes,
  applications can do the same thing and add a protected destructor
  to prevent non-heap allocation.

- Fixed a bug in slice2cpp that caused incorrect code to be generated
  if a class had a member that was an interface (not class) by value:

  interface I
  {
      void op();
  };

  class C
  {
      void op();
  };

  class MyClass
  {
      I myI;		// Note: I, not I*. Bad code generated for this in 3.1.0.
      I* myIstar;	// OK, no problem with 3.1.0.
      C myC;		// OK, no problem with 3.1.0.
      C myCstar;	// OK, no problem with 3.1.0.
  };

Changes since version 3.1.0
---------------------------     

- Fixed a bug in slice2docbook that could cause the "Used By" section of a
  symbol to list the same operation more than once.

- slice2doc book now adds a "Used By" section for exceptions. (Previously,
  exceptions did not have this section, only other types.)

- Fixed IceGrid allocation bug which could cause allocation failures
  when allocating multiple objects by type from allocatable servers
  and with the same session.

- Fixed the Slice translators to support spaces in paths of the
  -I option.

- Fixed a bug where proxy operator< could return an incorrect result
  for proxies of different types (e.g., direct vs. indirect proxies).

- Removed obsolete --no-globals option from slice2docbook.

- Fixed a bug in IceStorm where IceStorm stops sending events to
  linked topics if the linked topic becomes unavailable for any
  reason.

- Fixed a bug where the number of endpoints returned for a replica
  group with no load balancing policy was random.

- It's now possible to invoke on the IceGrid::Query object from an
  IceGrid admin session created through Glacier2.

- Fixed a Glacier2 shutdown bug where active sessions would not be
  destroyed properly.

- A bug was fixed where the glacier2router would throw a
  NullHandleException if a permission verifier was used that was not
  configured.

- Fixed a bug with the IceGrid allocate and sessionAllocation demos 
  where the session would not be destroyed in the event of an 
  allocation failure.

- Fixed a bug with config/ca/import.py script when importing
  certificates without an encrypted private key into a java keystore.

- Added support for Borland C++Builder 2006.

- Fixed a bug where variables from distribution descriptors were not
  substituted.

- Fixed an assert in the IceGrid locator implementation that could
  occur when using dynamic adapter registration. The assert was
  triggered when an adapter was removed and a client was requesting
  at the same time the adapter endpoints through the locator
  interface.

- Fixed a bug in the IceGrid replication code that would cause clients
  to get an Ice::NoEndpointException if the node of a replica was
  inactive.

- Fixed a bug in the IceGrid XML parser that could cause a crash if
  the adapter element for the IceBox.ServiceManager adapter was
  specified in the icebox element.

- Restored Communicator::setDefaultContext.

- Fixed a bug in Ice::initialize() that raised a NullHandleException
  when the function was called without arguments or when the
  properties member of InitializationData was null.

Changes since version 3.0.1
---------------------------

- Fixed a bug in slice2cpp that could cause incorrect code to
  be generated if a class contained a member to another class,
  but that class was only forward declared.

- Unsupported port to Solaris 10 on Intel/AMD contributed by
  Markus Bernhardt.

- Removed removeObjectFactory() from the communicator interface.

- Added a new object and server allocation mechanism to IceGrid. See
  the Ice manual for more information.

- The IceGrid XML descriptor <adapter> can only be used to specify
  indirect adapters. It's no longer possible to specify an adapter
  with an empty id. You can use properties to configure direct
  adapters.

- Fixed a bug where IceGrid would fail to register well-known objects
  with an identity containing reserved characters for proxies.

- Added "always" and "session" activation modes to IceGrid. See the
  Ice manual for more information.

- Changed the entry point of the IceSSL plug-in to be 
  IceSSL:createIceSSL.

- Changed the entry point of the IceStorm service to be 
  IceStormService,31:createIceStorm.

- ObjectAdapter::deactivate() now notifies the locator registry when
  the adapter is deactivated.

- Fixed ObjectAdapter::activate() to activate the object adapter
  only if it is able to register its endpoints and process proxy with
  the locator. Calling activate() again retries a failed registration.

- Glacier2.AllowCategories is now deprecated and superseded by
  Glacier2.Filter.Category.Accept.

- A new address filtering mechanism has been added to the Glacier2
  router. See the description of the Glacier2.Filter.Address.Accept
  and Glacier2.Filter.Address.Reject properties in the Ice manual
  for details.

- The Glacier2 router's identity-based filtering is now modifiable at
  runtime through the Glacier2::SessionControl interface.

- Generating new streaming functions for a Slice structure. The
  ice_write and ice_read member functions replace their internal
  equivalents (__write and __read).

- Removed getDefaultProperties() functions, and the global default
  properties. If you need global properties, you can easily create
  your own global variable.

- In Ice::Service, main(), run() and initializeCommunicator() now take
  a third parameter, const InitializationData&. It's defaulted for
  main() and run().

- The signature of createProperties(argc, argv) is now:

  PropertiesPtr createProperties(int* argc, char* argv[],
                                 const PropertiesPtr& defaults = 0,
				 const StringConverterPtr& conv = 0);

  where "defaults" represents an optional set of default properties
  used to initialize the new Properties object. Ice properties 
  defined on the command line and properties defined in a
  configuration file override these default properties.

- Fixed a bug in dumpdb so that it handles object graphs correctly.

- Fixed a bug where the proxy timeout, compress flag and connection
  id attributes would be ignored for direct proxies using a router.

- Added ability to configure Ice thread start/stop hooks through
  InitializationData.

- Added SSL authorization as an alternative to username/password
  for Glacier2. To authorize with SSL, use the new operation
  Glacier2::Router::createSessionFromSecureConnection(). On the
  server side, the new interfaces Glacier2::SSLPermissionsVerifier and
  Glacier2::SSLSessionManager must be implemented.

- The Glacier2.CryptPasswords property no longer has a default value.
  To reproduce the router's behavior from previous releases, define

  Glacier2.CryptPasswords=passwords

- Added identityToString and stringToIdentity to the Communicator
  interface. If a string converter is configured, these functions
  must be used instead of the current static functions.

- Added ability to configure user-defined string and wstring 
  converters that are used during marshalling/unmarshalling to
  convert between UTF8 (as required by the Ice protocol) and the
  user's character set.

- Added operators <=, > and >= for Slice classes, proxies and
  structures.

- Added operation that allows a Glacier2 session to be destroyed from
  a backend server.

- It is now possible to recreate a new object adapter with the same 
  name as an old adapter once waitForDeactivate() has completed on the
  old adapter.

- Added new operation Communicator::createObjectAdapterWithRouter(),
  which creates a routed object adapter. An object adapter may now
  be associated with at most one router, which is defined using this
  operation or by setting the <AdapterName>.Router property. Also
  as a result of this change, the ObjectAdapter::addRouter() and
  ObjectAdapter::removeRouter() operations have been removed.

- Added property sets to IceGrid descriptors. Property sets allow you
  to define a set of properties in application, node and template
  descriptors. These property sets can then be referenced from the
  server, service and instance descriptors. See the IceGrid chapter in
  the Ice manual for more information.

- Changed the IceGrid::Admin::getApplicationDescriptor operation to
  return the application descriptor without performing any variable
  substitutions.

- Fixed a bug in the adaptive load policy implementation that could
  cause the IceGrid registry to crash.
 
- Fixed a deadlock in the IceGrid registry that could occur when
  using the adaptive load balancing policy or the IceGrid::Query
  findObjectByTypeOnLeastLoadedNode operation.

- Added communicator initialize functions that takes an argument of
  type Ice::InitializationData. This structure contains communicator
  members that may only be set during communicator initialization.
  Currently included are Properties, Logger, Stats, default context,
  string converters and the thread hooks. The initializeWithXXX
  functions have been deprecated and the setLogger(), setStats() and
  setDefaultContext() operations have been removed.

- Added the new Slice metadata "deprecate" that can be used to
  qualify operations. On most platforms this will cause a compiler
  warning to be issued if user code uses the deprecated operation.

- Integrated contributed updates for Tru64.

- Added a new operation addProxies() to Ice::Router, which can return
  evicted proxies. The old operation addProxy() is now deprecated.
  Note that this is an internal interface for communications between
  clients and routers (such as Glacier2).

- Added a new property Glacier2.RoutingTable.MaxSize. If more proxies
  are added than permitted by this property, proxies are evicted from
  Glacier2's internal routing table on a least recently used basis.
  Ice clients from version 3.1 on will automatically retry operation
  calls on such evicted proxies, thereby re-adding them to Glacier2's
  routing table. Ice clients older than version 3.0 will receive an
  ObjectNotExistException. To continue to support such old clients,
  you must set the maximum high enough so that Glacier2 will not evict
  proxies. Upgrading your clients to 3.1 is highly recommended to avoid
  large routing table sizes in Glacier2.

- Replaced the IceSSL plug-in. The new plug-in no longer uses an XML
  configuration file but rather relies solely on properties. A Python
  script is provided in config/convertssl.py to convert old XML files
  to the new properties. See the Ice manual for more information on
  the plug-in.

- Added support for new Slice metadata ("cpp:type:wstring") that
  generates code to use std::wstring instead of std::string. See the
  Ice manual for more details.

- The ice_timeout and ice_compress proxy methods now correctly
  override the timeout and compress flag of indirect proxy endpoints.

- Added proxy methods ice_isSecure, ice_getLocator, ice_getRouter,
  ice_isCollocationOptimized.

- Deprecated the following proxy methods:

  ice_hash
  ice_communicator
  ice_collocationOptimization
  ice_connection
  ice_newIdentity
  ice_newFacet
  ice_newContext
  ice_newAdapterId
  ice_newEndpoints

  These methods will be removed in the next major release. You should
  use the new methods shown below:

  ice_getHash
  ice_getCommunicator
  ice_collocationOptimized
  ice_getConnection
  ice_identity
  ice_facet
  ice_context
  ice_adapterId
  ice_endpoints

- Changed the Ice core and services to use the random generator from
  IceUtil. The initialization of the communicator doesn't call srand
  or srand48 anymore. Your application should call it if necessary.

- Added random generator to IceUtil (in include/IceUtil/Random.h). The
  random generator is using /dev/urandom on Unix platforms and the
  cryptography API on Windows (CryptGenRandom).

- Added requestId to Current, which allows a servant to determine
  whether an operation was invoked with collocated, oneway or twoway
  semantics. The requestId member is 0 for oneway invocations and
  -1 for collocated invocations.

- Added typedefs for ProxyType and PointerType to the generated class 
  for Slice classes and interfaces to allow for easier templating.

- Fixed a bug in the Glacier2 router that could cause the router 
  to leak resources when a session is destroyed and hang on shutdown.

- Fixed a buffered mode bug in the Glacier2 router that could cause
  hangs in the router if a client misbehaved.

- AMI invocations will now reuse the connection cached with the
  proxy instead of always looking up an existing connection for
  each invocation. As a side effect of this change, AMI invocations 
  on a proxy with collocation optimization enabled will now raise
  Ice::CollocationOptimizationException.

- Added the property Ice.Default.LocatorCacheTimeout and the proxy
  method ice_locatorCacheTimeout(). If a cached endpoint is older
  than the configured cache timeout, the Ice runtime won't use
  the cached endpoint. Instead, the Ice runtime will query the
  Ice locator service to retrieve up-to-date endpoints and then update
  the locator cache. Please see the Ice manual for more information.

- Added the proxy method ice_endpointSelection, which allows an
  application to control how endpoints are selected at connection
  establishment. Two endpoint selection types are currently supported:
  Random and Ordered.

- Added the proxy method ice_connectionCached. This method allows you
  to enable or disable the caching of the connection by the proxy. By
  default, the proxy will cache the connection to avoid looking it up
  for each request. Disabling the connection caching is useful to do
  per-request load balancing: the proxy will select a connection for
  each request and the request will eventually be sent to different 
  servers.

- Removed the Ice.Warn.Leaks property.

- Performance improvements if an AMI callback object is reused with
  the same proxy.

- If several proxies share the same connection, and an operation call
  on one of the proxies causes a failure and the shared connection to
  be closed, then subsequent calls on the other proxies will try to
  establish a new connection instead of throwing an exception, even if
  retries are disabled.

- IcePatch2 now performs incremental reads of files during compression
  and checksum calculation. Previously the entire file being processed
  was read into memory.

- If a proxy is not configured with the -h parameter, Ice will now
  attempt to connect using all local interfaces. The loopback
  interface (127.0.0.1) will only be tried if it is the only local
  interface present.

- Added the ability to specify alternate mappings for Slice sequences
  other than std::vector. Please see the Ice manual for more details.

- Fixed a bug in slice2cpp that caused one-shot constructors for
  classes to incorrectly initialize base classes for class hierarchies
  three or more levels deep.

- Fixed a bug in slice2cpp that caused a compiler warning about an
  unused parameter in the generated code for operations on classes
  with void return type, no parameters, and no exception
  specification.

- Fixed a bug in the IceGrid deployment mechanism that would prevent
  the use of a variable in an object identity's category.

- Added Glacier2::Router::getCategoryForClient that should be used to
  get the category for Glacier2 client callback objects. This
  operation is a convenience that replaces the equivalent code
  getServerProxy()->ice_getIdentity().category.

- The Glacier2 router now forwards the context set by the client when
  calling PermissionsVerifier::checkPermissions and
  SessionManager::create.

- Fixed a bug in IceBox and IceGrid that would prevent running IceBox
  servers from a directory containing spaces.

- Fixed a bug in the class garbage collector that could result in
  double deallocation of class instances.

Changes since version 3.0.0
---------------------------

- Fixed an assert that could occur during connection establishment if
  the communicator was shutdown or destroyed concurrently.

- IceUtil::Time::toString() has been deprecated and should no longer
  be used. Instead, use IceUtil::Time::toDateTime() to get a date
  and time string. (toString() will continue to work as a synonym for
  two more releases and will then be removed.)

  IceUtil::Time::toDuration() is a new function that returns a
  duration string of the form "days hh:mm:ss.usec". (The number of
  days and micro seconds is printed only if they are non-zero.)

- Fixed a bug in the Slice parser that caused problems if an included
  file contained white space in the file name.

- Fixed a bug where the IceGrid node would fail to retrieve the CPU
  utilization on localized Windows versions.

- The Glacier2 router now logs a warning if a request arrives on an
  unknown connection if Glacier2.Client.Trace.Reject >= 1.

- Fixed a bug in IceGrid on Windows where environment variables set
  in server descriptors would not override those already set in the
  node's environment.

- Fixed a bug in slice2freeze in which using the --output-dir option
  was causing include paths to be modified in generated files.

- Fixed a bug where the IceGrid node, if installed as a Windows
  service, wouldn't correctly start on boot.

- Fixed a bug where the IceGrid node could incorrectly remove
  configuration files or database environment directories if they were
  not specified in alphabetical order (sorted by name) in the
  descriptor.

- Added --enable-new-dtags to Linux linker options.

- Added support for Apple Xcode 2.2.

- Windows x64 port; INSTALL.WINDOWS now shows how to target the x64
  platform.

Changes since version 2.1.2
---------------------------

- Added support for custom comparison in Freeze Maps. You can now
  provide your own compare functors for keys and indices. See the
  slice2freeze usage for the new options. The default behavior is
  backward compatible, comparing binary strings in the Ice encoding.

  Map have 4 new functions:

    - lower_bound (const and non-const)
    - upper_bound (const and non-const)

  In addition, the implementation of equal_range is now correct. 

  Generated index classes have 6 new functions:

    - lowerBoundFor<name> (const and non-const)
    - upperBoundFor<name> (const and non-const)
    - equalRangeFor<name> (const and non-const)

  The findBy<name> also takes a new bool parameter, "onlyDups"; its
  default value is true for compatibility with previous releases.
  When onlyDups is true, findBy<name> returns only the elements that
  match the given index value; when false, the iterator returns first
  these elements and then lets you iterate over the remainder of the
  database (according to the order defined by the index).

- Fixed a deadlock during shutdown that could happen with
  bi-directional connections.

- Removed ice_default() method from proxies.

- Added downgrade() to IceUtil::RWRecMutex and fixed a bug in
  upgrade(). Previously, upgrade() was equivalent to calling unlock()
  followed by writeLock(), which could allow a thread to acquire a
  write lock while another thread was in the middle of an upgrade.
  upgrade() is now atomic, so whatever state is protected by a read
  lock is guaranteed to remain unchanged when upgrade() completes.

- Connection::close(false) (i.e., graceful connection shutdown) now
  waits until all outstanding requests have completed.

- Added a new object adapter property, <adapter>.ReplicaGroupId, which
  allows adapters to be replicated. See the IceGrid chapter in the
  manual for more information.

- Added the following properties:

  IceBox.InstanceName
  IcePatch2.InstanceName
  IceStorm.InstanceName
  Glacier2.InstanceName

  These properties make it more convenient to configure multiple
  instances of these services by modifying the identity category of
  their well-known objects. The properties listed below are now
  deprecated and will be removed in a future release:

  IceBox.ServiceManager.Identity
  IcePatch2.Identity
  IcePatch2.AdminIdentity
  IceStorm.TopicManagerIdentity
  Glacier2.AdminIdentity
  Glacier2.RouterIdentity

- Added the proxy method ice_connectionId, which allows an application
  to control connection reuse.

- Added the new methods Ice::initializeWithLogger() and
  Ice::initializeWithPropertiesAndLogger(), which ensure that a custom
  logger is used to record any errors during communicator
  initialization.

- Ice will now listen on all local interfaces if no -h parameter is
  present in the endpoint configuration and no default host has been
  set. It will also listen to all interfaces if the -h parameter is
  set to 0.0.0.0. In such configurations the endpoints published in
  proxies will not contain the loopback interface (127.0.0.1) unless
  it is the only local interface present.

- Fixed a race condition with the object adapter holding state.

- Changed the way servant locators work if a server has a servant
  locator registered for a specific category, in addition to a default
  servant locator. Previously, if the locator for the specific
  category failed to locate the servant, the run time would then call
  the default locator. With the new behavior, if the locator for the
  specific category does not return a servant, the default locator is
  not called.

- Added proxy methods to retrieve the proxy adapter id and endpoints
  (ice_getAdapterId() and ice_getEndpoints()) and to create a new
  proxy with a new adapter id or new endpoints (ice_newAdapterId() and
  ice_newEndpoints()).

- Added Slice Ice::Endpoint local interface in slice/Ice/Endpoint.ice.

- Fixed a bug that would cause UDP server connections to be closed on
  transient errors, thus preventing the reception of any more UDP
  messages until a server restart.

- Communicator::setDefaultContext() no longer changes the context
  information set on existing proxies.

- slice2cpp and slice2freeze now provide the --add-header option. It
  adds a #include directive for the specified header at the beginning
  of the generated source file. For example:

      slice2cpp --add-header=precompiled.h x.ice

  adds "#include <precompiled.h> to the beginning of x.cpp (before any
  other include directives).

  You can specify an optional guard, for example:

      slice2cpp --add-header=precompiled.h,__PRECOMPILED_H__ x.ice

  With this, the beginning of x.cpp contains:

      #ifndef __PRECOMPILED_H__
      #define __PRECOMPILED_H__
      #include <precompiled.h>
      #endif

  You can repeat the --add-header option to include several headers in
  the generated source.

- Ice::Communicator::createObjectAdapter() throws
  Ice::AlreadyRegisteredException if it is called with the name of an
  object adapter that already exists.

- Fixed a bug in the slice2java code generator, which would cause
  incorrect code to be generated when metadata was used to modify
  dictionary types used as class or struct members.

- Fixed a bug in the slice2java code generator, which could cause
  incorrect code to be generated for certain custom sequence types.

- Fixed a bug in the slice2cs code generator: if an operation had a
  parameter named i or szx, incorrect code was generated in some
  cases.

- Fixed a bug in the slice2vb code generator: if an operation had a
  parameter named ix or spx, incorrect code was generated in some
  cases.

- Added unsupported and untested "support" for Tru64 (with gcc).

- Renamed CompressionNotSupportException to a more general
  FeatureNotSupportedException.

- Fixed a bug in proxyToString() for bidirectional proxies.

- Added ice_communicator() to proxies. This function returns the
  communicator that was used to create the proxy.

- Added ice_toString() to proxies. This function returns the
  stringified proxy. This function can be more convenient to use than
  communicator->stringToProxy() because you do not need the
  communicator to stringify a proxy that way.

  operator<< is overloaded for proxies and proxy handles, so you can
  write:

  Ice::ObjectPrx o = ...;
  cout << o << endl;		// Print stringified proxy, empty
				// string if o is null
  cout << *o << endl;		// Print stringified proxy

- IceUtil/Config.h no longer includes winsock.h under WIN32. Ice can
  now build with WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN.

- Removed operator timeval() from IceUtil::Time for WIN32.

- Parsing a stringified proxy no longer completely fails if the proxy
  contains an endpoint type that is unknown to the Ice runtime as long
  as the proxy contains other endpoints that are known. A warning is
  printed for the unknown types that are encountered.

- Ice::Object is now an abstract class that cannot be instantiated.
  This change should be transparent to application code.

- For abstract classes, ice_clone() now throws a
  CloneNotImplementedException if the concrete implementation class
  does not override ice_clone().  (Previously, ice_clone() incorrectly
  sliced the cloned abstract class to the most derived- concrete class
  or Ice::Object.)

- Added new features to the C++ mapping:

  - Classes and exceptions now have one-shot constructors. For
    example, for a class

      class Example {
          int i;
	  string s;
      };

    the following constructors are generated:

      class Example {
	  Example();
	  Example(::Ice::Int, const ::std::string&);
	  // ...
      };

    This allows you to construct a class or exception and supply
    values for the data members in a single statement, instead of
    having to assign to the members of a default-constructed instance.

    For derived exceptions and classes, the constructor expects values
    for all data members, including those of base exceptions or
    classes, in base-to-derived order of declaration.

  - Classes are now copyable and assignable. For example, using the
    previous Example class, the following statements are now valid
    (whereas, previously, they would have caused compile-time errors):

      Example e1;
      Example e2(1, "hello");
      e1 = e2;
      ExamplePtr ep1 = new Example();
      *ep1 = e2;

- Removed IceSSL's internal handshake retry loop, along with the
  related property IceSSL.Client.Handshake.Retries.

- Added support for OpenSSL 0.98.

Changes since version 2.1.1
---------------------------

- Fixed a bug in proxyToString() for bidirectional proxies.

- Fixed a bug with dynamic thread pools, where new threads were
  destroyed immediately after dispatch if <threadpool>.Size=1 and
  <threadpool>.SizeMax > 1.

- Fixed a few Windows bugs in the Ice::Service class.

- Fixed a bug in the Ice core involving command-line arguments that
  could result in an array access violation.

- Changed the Ice::Service class on Windows so that service failures
  do not cause the obscure message "Error1: Incorrect function".

- Removed the 64KB packet size limitation for TCP in Windows.

- Changed the C++ translator so that generated code no longer uses
  static function data.

- Fixed a bug in IcePack where stopping a server could hang if the
  server didn't answer the Ice::Process::shutdown() call.

- Changed IceStorm subscriber reaping to release dead subscribers
  more quickly from memory.

- Fixed a bug in IceStorm where the mode (idempotent or nonmutating)
  of the request wasn't correctly forwarded to the subscribers.

- Added IcePack.Registry.AdminIdentity, IcePack.Registry.QueryIdentity
  and IcePack.Registry.LocatorIdentity properties to allow configuring
  the identities of well-known IcePack registry interfaces.

- Added the configuration property Ice.Compression.Level to provide
  more control over the bzip2 algorithm used to compress Ice protocol
  messages.

- Fixed a bug in the Glacier2 router where buffered mode serialized
  twoway requests when it should not.

Changes since version 2.1.0
---------------------------

- Fixed bug with the random selection of an endpoint for a proxy with
  multiple endpoints configured. The random number generator used
  by GCC was not being seeded, causing the selection order to always
  be the same.

- Fixed Slice compilers to allow file names containing whitespace.

- Fixed a thread pool bug on Win32 in which the file descriptors for
  the pipe were not closed.

- Fixed a bug in Freeze Maps: you can now add an index to an existing
  Freeze Map.

- Added sequences of fixed-length elements to throughput demo.

- Added RTLD_GLOBAL when calling dlopen on Unix platforms.

- Fixed a bug that could cause an assert if connections could not be
  established in thread-per-connection mode.

- Added two new properties for controlling Active Connection
  Management (ACM). In prior releases ACM was governed by the property
  Ice.ConnectionIdleTime, which affected client- and server-side
  behavior. The new properties, Ice.ACM.Client and Ice.ACM.Server,
  now allow independent timeouts to be specified for client- and
  server-side ACM. Ice.ConnectionIdleTime is now deprecated.

- Reverted a change introduced in 2.1.0 in which retries were not
  attempted for oneway and batch oneway requests. Ice now behaves
  as it did in prior releases: if the connection associated with a
  oneway or batch oneway proxy is closed, an invocation on the proxy
  will transparently reestablish the connection. Please see the Ice
  manual for more information on the reliability of oneway and batch
  oneway reliability.

- A race condition with Glacier2 detaching the request handler thread
  has been fixed.

- Added -E option to the various Slice compilers to print preprocessor
  output on stdout.

- Ice::ObjectNotExistException is now retried for invocations made on
  indirect proxies. This allows the transparent migration of objects
  or objects adapters.

- As announced with version 1.5, slice2cpp and slice2freeze now
  require all Slice definitions to be nested inside a module;
  definitions at global scope (other than module definitions) now
  cause a hard error (whereas, previously, they only caused a
  warning).

- Fixed a bug in the option parsing for Ice tools such as slice2cpp,
  slice2java, slice2cs, etc. The option parser used to incorrectly
  complain about repeated options when in fact no option was
  repeated. Also changed the parser to permit options to follow an
  argument, so

      slice2cpp -I. x.ice

  and

      slice2cpp x.ice -I.

  are now equivalent.

- Fixed bug where the IcePack node with a collocated registry wouldn't
  terminate after the admin "shutdown" command.

- The Windows demo/IcePatch2/MFC example displays an error dialog when
  the patch client is run without the --IcePatch2.Endpoints option.

- Fixed bug where data transfer statistics were not being reported on
  outgoing datagram requests.

Changes since version 2.0.0
---------------------------

- Fixed bug in the code generators for C# and VB: for sequences
  of structs and sequences of Object*, incorrect code was generated
  if a ["cs:collection"] or ["vb:collection"] metadata directive
  was used.

- We do not retry oneway or batch oneway requests anymore, except if
  there are problems during connection establishment. If we retry a
  oneway or batch oneway, previous oneways from the same batch, or
  previous oneways that are buffered by the IP stack implementation,
  are silently thrown away. This can lead to a situation where the
  latest oneway succeeds due to retry, but former oneways are
  discarded.

- Fixed race between connection validation and activation for UDP
  endpoints in thread-per-connection mode.

- Fixed a deadlock that could occur if a server cannot send data
  during connection validation.

- Glacier2 could hang if a server is not running. This has been fixed.

- Added support for g++ builds on Solaris.

- Fixed IcePack node and registry database environment names. They
  have been changed to be the name of the node for IcePack nodes and
  'Registry' for the IcePack registry. This means that you can now
  configure the database environment using the properties prefixed
  with Freeze.DbEnv.<node name> or Freeze.DbEnv.Registry.

- Fixed a bug where the endpoint cache for indirect proxies wasn't
  always cleared upon a communication failure with an object.

- Fixed a race condition in the IcePack on-demand server activation
  code which could cause clients to hang under rare conditions if the
  server couldn't be activated.

- Fixed a small memory leak in the IcePack node that would occur each
  time a process is forked (Unix only).

- Added 'object list' and 'object describe' IcePack admin commands.

- Changed the signature of IcePack::Admin::removeObject() to take the
  identity of the object instead of its proxy.

- Connection validation now checks for the timeout specified by the
  property Ice.Override.ConnectTimeout and will raise
  Ice::ConnectTimeoutException if the connection validation times out.

- Fixed an assert that could occur during connection establishment if
  no more file descriptors are available.

- Improved support for on-demand server activation in IcePack.

- Improved the IcePack registry to prevent potential deadlocks caused
  by thread starvation.

- The Ice manual stated that the IcePack configuration property
  IcePack.Registry.Internal.Endpoints was only necessary when nodes
  were being used, but in fact the property is required regardless
  of whether nodes are used. The manual has been updated accordingly.

- Fixed a bug where Ice::ObjectAdapter::activate() could throw
  Ice::ObjectAdapterDeactivatedException if the object adapter was
  deactivated concurrently.

- Fixed a bug where setting the locator proxy on an indirect proxy
  could cause an assert.

- Fixed a bug in IceSSL when multiple communicators are used.

- Added an optimization to the Freeze evictor for the ice_ping
  operation. The object is no longer loaded into the cache by this
  operation; Freeze simply checks if the object is in the cache or
  the database.

- Fixed a slice2cpp failure when the --output-dir option specified a
  directory containing backslashes.

- Changed the signature of Ice::Service::main() and
  Ice::Service::run() to accept a reference to argc (int & argc)
  rather than passing argc by value (int argc). This is to ensure
  that, if Ice::initialize() or Ice::Service::initializeCommunicator()
  rewrites argv, argc reflects the number of elements of the rewritten
  argument vector.

- Fixed an encoding bug in IceSSL.

- Fixed incorrect logging message if no more endpoints are available
  for retry.

- Added setDefaultContext() and getDefaultContext() to the
  Ice::Communicator interface. This allows a default context to be
  established on a communicator-wide basis. See section 29.9.3 in the
  doc.

  Added ice_defaultContext to Ice::ObjectProxy. This creates a new
  proxy that uses the default context established on the communicator.

- Fixed a rare proxy marshaling bug that could cause the receiver to
  encounter an UnmarshalOutOfBoundsException.

- Overloaded the checkedCast member function of the generated Prx
  classes to allow a trailing argument of type Ice::Context. This
  makes it possible to do stateful things that require a context in a
  servant locator's activate() method.

- Added catalogs for Freeze: each database environment used by Freeze
  now contains a special dictionary (named __catalog) that keeps track
  of all evictor and dictionary databases in this environment.

- Fixed a bug in slice2cs and slice2vb: incorrect code was generated
  if an interface was derived from a base interface in a different
  module and if the base interface contained an AMD operation.

Changes since version 1.5.1
---------------------------

- Fixed a bug in IcePack which could cause a core dump of the IcePack
  registry or node when updating an application deployment.

- The proxy returned by the object adapter operations addFacet and
  addFacetWithUUID did not contain the facet. This required the
  application to make an extra call to ice_newFacet in order to
  obtain the correct proxy. This has been fixed.

- Added the object adapter property <name>.PublishedEndpoints, which
  specifies endpoints to advertise in proxies created by the adapter.

- For WIN32, Thread::getThreadControl() set the thread id of the
  ThreadControl object to the current thread instead of the thread the
  control object belongs to. This has been fixed.

- Changed Ice::Service to use _exit() in the daemon parent.

- Fixed a bug with AMD exception handling, where it was possible that
  certain exceptions propagate out of ice_response() or
  ice_exception(), and therefore such exceptions were not handled
  properly.

- Exceptions raised while marshaling data for batch requests resulted
  in a connection deadlock. This has been fixed.

- Fixed a bug in slice2cs: the generated code was incorrect for
  dictionaries with sequence value types, if that sequence value type
  was mapped to an array.

- Fixed bug in IcePack that would prevent dynamically added adapters
  from being used again after the IcePack registry was restarted.

- Fixed tracing of operation mode.

- Fixed bug in slice2cpp: for statically linked binaries under
  Windows, exceptions and classes could cause an
  UnmarshalOutOfBoundsException.

- Fixed bug in slice2java: with the --impl-tie option, incorrect code
  was generated for local interfaces and classes.

- Tightened semantic check for all Slice compilers: previously, a
  local interface or class could be derived from a non-local interface
  or class. This is now correctly diagnosed as an error.

- Changed code generation in slice2java: for local interfaces, only an
  OperationsNC (but no Operations) interface is generated
  now. (Previously, both interfaces were generated, with one of them
  being empty.)

- The IceSSL plug-in was using regular mutexes in some places where
  static mutexes are necessary. This has been fixed.

- Fixed a bug in the garbage collector that caused a crash in rare
  circumstances.

- Freeze dictionaries now support indices. You can index on the full
  value of the dictionary, or on a member (when the value is a struct
  or a class). When you index on a member, you can define several
  indices (for different members). See the Freeze bench demo and the
  Freeze dbmap test for examples.

- The Ice::Service class no longer resets the umask to 0, but rather
  uses the inherited umask.

- Fixed a code generation problem in slice2cpp. This problem showed up
  only for the --impl option.

- Changed the way C++ keywords are escaped. Previously, a Slice
  identifier that is a C++ keyword was escaped everywhere. For
  example, Slice "while" was mapped to "_cpp_while" and
  "_cpp_whilePrx". With the change, Slice "while" is mapped to
  "_cpp_while" and "whilePrx".

- Fixed the slice2java and slice2cs compilers for operations with
  multiple exceptions in an exception specification: if an exception
  was a base of one or more other exceptions in the same exception
  specification, the code generator sometimes emitted the catch blocks
  in the marshaling and dispatch code in the wrong order. (This
  applied only to interfaces with an ["amd"] metadata directive.)

- Fixed a bug in the slice2cs code generator:
  
  ["cs:collection"] sequence<Object> S1;
  ["cs:collection"] sequence<Object*> S2;

  Sequences of Object or Object* caused incorrect code to be generated
  if they were marked as "cs:collection".

- Fixed a bug in the slice2cs code generator: for nested sequences,
  incorrect code was generated if both the inner and the outer
  sequence were mapped as arrays.

- Fixed a number of bugs in slice2cs that caused incorrect code to be
  generated if C# keywords were used as Slice identifiers.

- Fixed a bug in slice2cpp that permitted impossible exceptions to be
  received by a client if client and server used Slice definitions
  with mismatched exception specifications. The client now correctly
  receives UnknownUserException if the server throws an exception
  that, according to the client's view of the operation, is
  impossible.

- The documentation has always stated that same-named constructs
  cannot be directly nested inside each other. (For example, a module
  `M' cannot contain a constant named `M'.) The Slice compilers did
  not enforce this correctly up to now for modules containing
  constructs with the same name as the enclosing module.  This has
  been fixed and now results in a diagnostic.

- The slice2cpp compiler now deprecates Slice definitions at global
  scope: only modules can be defined at global scope. Everything else
  (constants, classes, interfaces, etc.) must be defined inside a
  module.

  For the time being, the compiler issues a warning for each global
  definition but continues to compile the code. Global non-module
  definitions will elicit a hard error two releases from now.

- Several demos used Slice classes where interfaces were more
  appropriate. This has been fixed.

- Fixed a bug in the Windows IcePack registry project that would cause
  a compilation error if the registry was compiled before the node.

- Fixed a hang in the IcePack registry that would occur if multiple
  nodes were started simultaneously.

- Added new properties Ice.StdErr and Ice.StdOut to redirect the
  standard error and output streams of a process. Reimplemented
  IcePack's error/output redirection using these properties.

Changes since version 1.5.0
---------------------------

- The relevant Windows project files were fixed to generate Slice
  checksums.

- Fixed harmless warnings emitted by the IcePatch client.

- Fixed a bug in IceStorm that caused a subscriber to no longer
  receive events after unsubscribing and resubscribing to the same
  topic.

- Fixed a bug in the slice2cs code generator: classes with multiple
  sequence members caused incorrect code to be generated.

- Added work-around for clients "hanging" at exit when using IcePack
  on Windows.

Changes since version 1.4.0
---------------------------

- Added support for generating checksums of Slice definitions,
  enabling peers to verify that they share the same client-server
  contract. See the manual for more information.

- Fixed a bug that could cause an assert or exception in some rare
  circumstances, if an operation is invoked after the object adapter
  for the Ice object has been deactivated.

- Fixed a bug in the C++ translator that caused compile errors when
  two Slice classes with the same name appeared in different modules
  in the same file.

- Changed the names of Windows executables to lower case, for
  consistency with non-Windows platforms. The following executables
  have been renamed:

    DumpDB.exe		-> dumpdb.exe
    GlacierRouter.exe	-> glacierrouter.exe
    GlacierStarter.exe	-> glacierstarter.exe
    IcePackNode.exe	-> icepacknode.exe
    IcePackRegistry.exe	-> icepackregistry.exe
    IcePatchCalc.exe	-> icepatchcalc.exe
    TransformDB.exe	-> transformdb.exe

  All library names have also been renamed accordingly.

- Changed the default behavior of the IcePatch client to dynamically
  calculate the unique signatures of local files in order to reduce
  the number of cache files, and added the property IcePatch.Dynamic
  to control this behavior.

- AIX 5.2/VisualAge 6.0 port.

- Changed the --depend option of slice2java. If you get dependencies
  for a file x.ice that includes y.ice, the dependency line that is
  written now is "x.ice: y.ice". (Previously, it was "x.cpp: x.ice
  y.ice".) If a Slice file does not include any other Slice file, no
  dependency is printed. With some post-processing, this is sufficient
  to generate dependencies for tools such as ant and make.

- Removed IceBox::ServiceBase and IceBox::FreezeService. There's now a
  single IceBox::Service interface.

- IcePack descriptors have been redesigned. See the manual for more
  information on the new descriptor format.

- Some IcePack improvements:
  
  * Descriptors are now parsed only by the icepackadmin tool,
    therefore it is no longer necessary to store the descriptor files
    on each IcePack node or registry host.
  
  * It is now possible to update an application or server deployment
    by modifying its XML descriptor and using the `application update'
    or `server update' commands in icepackadmin.

  * It is now possible to define variables from the icepackadmin
    command line when deploying or updating an application or server.

  * An icepackadmin `node remove' command has been added to clean up
    resources associated with a given node.

  * A command line option `--checkdb' has been added to the
    icepacknode executable. When the node is started with this option,
    it performs a consistency check on its database to remove servers
    that are no longer registered with the IcePack registry.

Changes since version 1.3.0
---------------------------

- Added a fix to the mutex tests in test/IceUtil/thread for FreeBSD.

- Modified the Ice::Service class to support the Ice.Nohup property,
  rename the win9x function to checkSystem, and add more flexibility
  in configuring services. See the reference manual for more
  information.

- Added unsupported FreeBSD port.

- Ice now builds with GCC 3.4.0.

- Fixed a bug when making asynchronous invocations on a routed proxy.

- Removed slice2wsdl.

- Changed the way sequences are unmarshaled to protect against
  malicious messages with faked very large sequence count values.
  While even with previous versions of Ice, buffer overruns were
  impossible, malicious messages could cause large amounts of memory
  to be preallocated, causing the receiving process to run out of
  memory. This is no longer possible -- the total amount of memory
  preallocated for sequences during unmarshaling is now capped at
  Ice.MessageSizeMax.

- Freeze Evictor changes to adapt to the facet redesign, and 
  make several improvements:
  
  * The Freeze Evictor now has add, addFacet, remove and removeFacet
    operations with the same signature and behavior as the Ice
    ObjectAdapter.

  * The createObject and destroyObject operations were kept for 
    compatibility with Ice 1.2/1.3, but are now deprecated.

  * getIterator now takes a facet parameter, and no longer takes
    a loadServants parameter.

  * Indices can now be defined for facets (not just the "" facet).
 
  * The ServantInitializer initialize operation now takes a facet
    parameter. 

  * The ServantInitializer is now provided to the Evictor in the
    createEvictor call. In this way, the Evictor can consider the
    servant initializer immutable and avoid locking.

  * Servant initialization is now performed without holding any
    Evictor locks. As a result, a servant initializer can perform
    any remote call, except one that comes back to the object
    being initialized (which would result in a deadlock).

  * The Evictor is now associated with a single object adapter;
    this object adapter is provided in the createEvictor call.

  * The Evictor is now "deactivate-safe": if you deactivate the
    evictor while other threads are performing other Evictor 
    operations, deactivate() will wait until these operations
    have completed.

  * The new keep and release operations let you lock and unlock 
    an object in an Evictor's cache.

- Removed a bogus assert that could happen under certain race
  conditions when a connection timeout occurs.

- Facets have been significantly redesigned.

  * Facets are no longer hierarchical. As a result, FacetPath (which
    was a sequence of strings) is now simply a string. This is
    reflected in all APIs that used FacetPath.

  * There is no longer an active facet map in Ice::Object. As a
    result, the following operations have been removed:

    + On proxies: ice_facets, ice_appendFacet.

    + On Object: ice_facets, ice_addFacet, ice_removeFacet,
      ice_updateFacet, ice_removeAllFacets, ice_findFacet,
      ice_findFacetPath.

  * The object adapter is now used to register facets instead of the
    active facet map. The following operations have been added to
    Ice::ObjectAdapter: addFacet, addFacetWithUUID, removeFacet,
    removeAllFacets, findFacet, and findAllFacets.

    Please see the reference manual for more information. For naming
    consistency, the following object adapter operations have been
    renamed:

    + identityToServant has been renamed to find.
    + proxyToServant has been renamed to findByProxy.

  * This object model design change means that facets are no longer
    transferred with an object sent by value.

  * If your application receives an object with facets from an older
    version of Ice, a MarshalException is raised. This is unavoidable
    because it is a change to the object model, and not just to the
    way objects are transferred or encoded.

  * If your application receives a request or reply with a facet path
    with more than one element, the run time throws a MarshalException.

  * If your application receives a proxy with a facet path with
    more than one element, the run time throws ProxyUnmarshalException.

- Ice no longer retries operation calls on RequestFailedException.
  (ObjectNotExistException, OperationNotExistException, and
  FacetNotExistException are derived from RequestFailedException.)

- Fixed link errors when building Ice without BerkeleyDB in the
  shared library search path.

- Added ConnectionRefusedException as a specialization of
  ConnectFailedException, to indicate if a connection fails because a
  server actively refuses the connection.

- The documentation claimed that the Ice.ProgramName property was
  initialized to the value of argv[0], but that initialization was in
  fact not happening. As of this version, Ice.ProgramName is
  initialized correctly.

- Fixed the slice2cpp compiler for operations with multiple exceptions
  in an exception specification: if an exception was a base of one or
  more other exceptions in the same exception specification, the code
  generator sometimes emitted the catch blocks in the marshaling and
  dispatch code in the wrong order.

Changes since version 1.2.0
---------------------------

- Added FreezeScript, which consists of the tools dumpdb and
  transformdb for inspecting and migrating Freeze databases,
  respectively.

- The IceStorm server now uses a single database for all topics,
  which makes topic creation much faster.

- Added the virtual member functions ice_preMarshal and
  ice_postUnmarshal to Ice::Object. The default implementations do
  nothing, but subclasses may override them to take special action
  before marshaling and after unmarshaling, respectively.

- Added the demo/IcePack/simple example.

- Fixed a bug in IcePack that could cause the node to crash if a
  server failed to start.

- IceBox services deployed with IcePack are now loaded in the order
  they appear in the XML IceBox descriptor.

- Connections are no longer closed when the last proxy using the
  connection is destroyed. Doing so is error prone:

  * Quite often, proxies are created on the fly, resulting in
    connections being opened and closed all the time. This is
    especially true for services that receive a proxy and data, and
    then forward this data using the proxy.

  * Often, connections are stay open for too long, because proxies are
    kept even though they are never used again.

  * It doesn't work well with AMI requests, because the AMI callback
    objects keep track of connections directly. This would mean that
    if a process only uses AMI requests, a connection is opened and
    closed for each request, as each request typically has its own
    AMI callback object.

  Instead, ACM (Automatic Connection Management) is now enabled by
  default, with a default value of one minute. This means that idle
  connections are closed after one minute, regardless of whether there
  are proxies using the connection or not. This closing of connections
  is transparent, i.e., closed connections are automatically
  reestablished in case they are needed again. Please see the
  description of the Ice.ConnectionIdleTime property for details.

- ACM has been completely reworked. It now works properly with respect
  to retrying failed requests.

- Added the IceSSL.Client.IgnoreValidPeriod and
  IceSSL.Server.IgnoreValidPeriod properties. See the description in
  the manual for details.

- Added the IceBox.LoadOrder property, which specifies the order
  in which IceBox services are loaded.

- Added support for the Intel C++ compiler (v8.0) on Linux x86.

- Removed the Ice.Daemon, Ice.DaemonNoChdir and Ice.DaemonNoClose
  properties. Support for Unix daemons and Win32 services has been
  integrated into the Ice::Service class.

- The default thread pool size is now just one thread. This is the
  fastest possible setting, still allows one level of nesting, and
  doesn't require that servants be thread safe. (Please see the
  description of the thread pool properties in the manual for
  information on how to increase the number of threads.)

- HP-UX port. See INSTALL.HP-UX.

- Added extra file integrity checks to IcePatch::Client.

- Fixed a problem with servers not shutting down properly under
  certain circumstances.

- IceUtil::Thread now calls srand() in each new thread (Windows only).

- When unmarshaling a string sequence parameter, Ice was not clearing
  the vector before appending elements to it. This has been fixed.
  
- Fixed a rare connection deadlock, that could happen if lots of long
  messages are sent rapidly in parallel, using separate threads or
  AMI.

- Fixed a race condition that could lead to a deadlock if a thread
  tried to join with another thread from within the destructor of a
  servant or class.

- Added support for IcePack and Glacier on Windows platforms.
  The IcePack Registry, IcePack Node and Glacier Starter programs
  can optionally be installed as Windows services. See the Ice
  manual for more information.

- Added a new logger implementation that uses the Windows Event Log.
  To use it, set the Ice.UseEventLog property to a non-zero value.

- Three new icepackadmin commands:

  * server signal NAME SIGNAL

    Causes the IcePackNode to send a signal to a server. (Unix only)

  * server stdout NAME MESSAGE

    Writes MESSAGE on server's stdout.

  * server stderr NAME MESSAGE

    Writes MESSAGE on server's stderr.

- Two new IcePack.Node properties:

  * IcePack.Node.Output=<path>

    If set, the IcePack node will redirect the stdout and stderr 
    output of the started servers to files named <server>.out and 
    <server>.err in this directory. Otherwise, the started servers 
    share the stdout and stderr of the IcePack node.

  * IcePack.Node.RedirectErrToOut=<num>

    If <num> is set to a value larger than zero, the stderr of each
    started server is redirected to the server's stdout.

- Added Slice interface Ice::Process in slice/Ice/Process.ice. This
  interface enables IcePack to properly shut down a process without
  relying on signals, which is necessary for successful operation
  on Windows.

- Added setServerProcessProxy to Ice::LocatorRegistry.

- Added new properties <ObjectAdapter>.RegisterProcess and
  Ice.ServerId. If RegisterProcess is defined, the object adapter
  creates a servant implementing the Ice::Process interface and
  registers it with the locator registry using the server id
  defined by Ice.ServerId.

- Added the "register" attribute to the <adapter> element in the
  IcePack descriptors. If true, the RegisterProcess property is
  defined for the object adapter.

- Added getLocator to ObjectAdapter.

- Eliminated Glacier's dependency on the crypt library. It now
  uses an equivalent function from OpenSSL.

- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash if an application used
  Ice::Application and was interrupted by a signal, resulting
  in two calls to Communicator::destroy().

- Replaced interface Glacier::PasswordVerifier with
  Glacier::PermissionsVerifier, property
  Glacier.Starter.PasswordVerifier with
  Glacier.Starter.PermissionsVerifier, and changed
  Glacier::Starter::startRouter() to throw PermissionDeniedException
  instead of InvalidPasswordException.

- Fixed a problem with the random selection of SSL endpoints.

- Ice is now supported on Windows 98 SE. See INSTALL.WINDOWS.

- Fixed an incorrect complaint in the Slice parser about a change of
  meaning for enumeration constant definitions.

- The glacierrouter and glacierstarter processes used to abort if
  given a non-existent config file.

- Changed Ice::Exception::ice_name() to return const std::string&
  instead of returning a string by value.

- Added support for "global" metadata, which can only be specified
  once in a file and must appear before any definitions. The syntax
  is similar to that of local metadata, but with an extra set of
  brackets: [["metadata1","metadata2","etc."]]. The first use of this
  metadata is for specifying a package in Java.

- The IcePatch server no longer changes the working directory.
  This avoids potential problems with core files being generated in
  the data directory.

- Ice now uses gethostbyname_r() if available.

- Errors during close() or shutdown() on connections now cause
  exceptions.

- Fixed a deadlock that could happen if requests were sent from the
  exception() AMI callback.

- Eliminated the need to define _UNICODE when building Ice on Windows.

- Fixed problems with generated code in slice2cpp and slice2freeze
  when --header-ext is used.

- The Slice parser and database transformer didn't parse negative
  floating-point numbers correctly. This has been fixed.

- If the Glacier Starter couldn't start the Glacier Router, the
  starter terminated. This has been fixed.

- Visual C++ 7.x builds can now be used by applications built with 
  /Zc:wchar_t.

- Fixed a bug in IceSSL that caused the error message "WRN unable
  to load certificate authorities" to be logged when no value
  was specified for the "path" attribute of <certauthority>.

- Added property Ice.Override.ConnectTimeout. See the manual for
  details.

- Fixed a rare deadlock in the object adapter, when a locator was
  used.

- Fixed a bug that could cause an abort if communicators were created
  and destroyed in rapid succession.

- Fixed transformdb to take separate arguments for specifying
  include paths. The option -I has been replaced with the options
  --include-old and --include-new.

- Added twoway-throttling to Glacier. See the descriptions of the
  properties Glacier.Router.Client.Throttle.Twoways and
  Glacier.Router.Server.Throttle.Twoways for details. To trace
  throttling, set the property Glacier.Router.Trace.Throttle.

- The properties Glacier.Router.Client.BatchSleepTime and
  Glacier.Router.Server.BatchSleepTime have been replaced with
  Glacier.Router.Client.SleepTime and Glacier.Router.Server.SleepTime.
  Please see the description of the properties in the manual for the
  new semantics of the sleep times.

- Added STL functors for partial proxy comparison:

  * ProxyIdentityLess
  * ProxyIdentityEqual
  * ProxyIdentityAndFacetLess
  * ProxyIdentityAndFacetEqual

- A DNSException could cause a deadlock. This has been fixed.

- Changed FD_SETSIZE under Windows to 1024. (The default permits only
  64 concurrent connections, which is too small for some applications.)

- The IcePatch server now ignores Ice exceptions in the update thread
  instead of terminating the update thread.

- Fixed a concurrency bug that could cause the IcePack registry to
  crash.

Changes since version 1.1.1
---------------------------

- Added a garbage collector for class graphs that form cycles. (See
  the C++ mapping chapter in the documentation for details.)

- Manual retry in the exception() callback of asynchronous requests
  didn't work. This has been fixed.

- Fixed a crash that could happen during shutdown.

- Fixed a deadlock that could happen during connection establishment.

- Fixed deadlock during shutdown that can happen if a thread pool with
  only one thread is used.

- Moved UserExceptionFactory from Ice namespace to IceInternal namespace
  because UserExceptionFactory is no longer an interface for use
  by applications.

- Bi-directional connections are now handled by the client-side thread
  pool instead of the server-side thread pool.

- Fixed a bug in the generated code that caused "at-most-once"
  semantics to be ignored for collocated invocations.

- Removed all Ice dependencies on Xerces. Added a simple C++ wrapper
  around the expat XML parser as IceXML/Parser.h.

- Implemented TwowayOnlyException. That exception is raised if an
  attempt is made to invoke an operation that has a return value,
  out parameters, or an exception specification via a oneway or
  datagram proxy.

- Removed ice_flush() on the proxy base class. Batch requests are
  now flushed by calling Communicator::flushBatchRequests(). This
  flushes all requests that are currently batched in the communicator,
  (for all connections).

- Added back the connection closure timeout, but only for misbehaving
  peers. If a timeout is set, and a peer doesn't react to a close
  connection message, the connection is forcefully closed after the
  timeout. However, it is never forcefully closed if requests are
  still outstanding. Doing so would violate ordering guarantees for
  finished() and deactivate() on servant locators.

- Fixed a bug in the slice2java code generator: if a parameter was
  named "current", illegal code was generated.

- Fixed a bug in the slice2java code generator: tie classes were not
  generated correctly for operations with an "amd" metadata directive.

- On Windows, you can now build IceUtil in such a way that mutexes 
  are used instead of critical sections. See IceUtil/Config.h.

- Fixed a bug where Ice would print a dispatch warning for
  Ice::RequestFailedException even if the Ice.Warn.Dispatch property
  was set to 1.

- Added per-proxy contexts. The change is source-code compatible with
  the previous approach, that is, it is still possible to pass an
  explicit Ice::Context to an operation call as an additional,
  trailing parameter. However, IceProxy::Ice::Object now contains two
  new operations:

  - ice_getContext()

    This returns the context currently associated with a particular
    proxy by value. (By default, the context associated with proxies
    is empty.)

  - ice_newContext(const ::Ice::Context& context)

    This creates a new proxy that is associated with the passed
    context. Thereafter, calls via the new proxy always pass the
    context that was passed to ice_newContext() when that proxy was
    created.

  The net effect of this is that it is now possible to establish the
  context for a proxy once and, thereafter, have that same context
  sent automatically whenever an operation is invoked via the proxy
  (instead of having to pass an explicit context parameter on every
  call).

- Added Ice::Properties::parseIceCommandLineOptions(). This operation
  converts to properties all options that start with one of the
  following prefixes: --Ice, --IceBox, --IcePack, --IcePatch,
  --IceSSL, --IceStorm, --Freeze, and --Glacier.

- Added ice_clone() member function to non-abstract classes.
  ice_clone() polymorphically copies a class instance. The copy is a
  deep copy for all types except for class members; class members are
  copied shallow, that is, if a class contains a class member, the
  original and the clone contain a Ptr that points at the same single
  class instance.

- Improved marshaling performance for built-in types (byte, bool,
  short, int, long, float, double, and string). This is noticeable in
  particular when transmitting sequences of these types, sequences of
  structures containing these types, or large dictionaries containing
  these types.

- Added menu with several options to throughput demo.

- Major Freeze update:

  - Removed support for the XML encoding. Freeze now always uses the
    binary encoding.

  - Removed the lowest Freeze layer. You should now use Berkeley
    DB directly.

  - Replaced the database transformation tool with one that supports
    the binary encoding.

  - For Freeze Maps and Evictors, the underlying Berkeley DB
    environment is now always transactional. New configuration
    variables:

      - Freeze.DbEnv.<envName>.DbHome provides the path to the DB home, 
        and defaults to <envName>.

      - Freeze.DbEnv.<envName>.DbRecoverFatal triggers "fatal recovery" 
        when set to a value other than 0 (defaults to 0).

      - Freeze.DbEnv.<envName>.DbPrivate when set to a value other than 0
        tells Berkeley DB to use process private memory instead of
        shared memory. Defaults to 1. Set it to 0 when you want to run
        db_archive (or another Berkeley DB utility) on a running
        environment.

      - Freeze.DbEnv.<envName>.DbCheckpointPeriod: each Berkeley DB
        environment created by Freeze has an associated thread that
        checkpoints this environment every DbCheckpointPeriod seconds.
        Defaults to 120 seconds.

      - Freeze.DbEnv.<envName>.PeriodicCheckpointMinSize defines the 
        minimum size in kbytes for the periodic checkpoint (see above). 
        This value is passed to Berkeley DB's checkpoint function. Defaults
        to 0 (no minimum).

      - Freeze.DbEnv.<envName>.OldLogsAutoDelete: when set to a value 
        other than 0, old transactional logs no longer in use are deleted
        after each periodic checkpoint. Defaults to 1.

       - Freeze.Trace.Map: trace the Map operations

       - Freeze.Trace.DbEnv: trace the operations on the DbEnv, which
         is shared between Maps and Evictors.

     Such a Freeze-created Berkeley DB environment is created and
     opened when the first Freeze Map or Evictor using it is created,
     and is closed when the last Freeze Map or Evictor using it is
     closed.

  - Freeze Map update:

    Freeze Maps are now opened/created directly using their constructor:

    C++: Map(const Freeze::ConnectionPtr& connection, 
             const std::string& dbName, 
             bool createDb = true);

    Java: public
          Map(Connection connection, 
              String dbName, 
              boolean createDb);

    Connection is a new local interface similar to the DBEnvironment
    local interface (which was removed). However, Connection is not
    thread-safe: access to a given Connection object must be serialized.
    A connection can be used to create a Transaction (similar to the
    old DBTransaction); likewise, a Transaction is not thread-safe. 

    To access concurrently the "same" map, you should create multiple
    connections and associated maps.

    In Java, it is necessary to call close() on the Map if you want to
    close the underlying Berkeley DB database (and indirectly the
    environment) before the Map is finalized.

    As a consequence of using a transactional Berkeley DB environment,
    all Map writes are now transactional:

    - Non-iterator writes use DB_AUTO_COMMIT.

    - Writable iterators (non-const C++ iterators, Java Iterators)
      have an associated transaction that is committed when the
      iterator is closed.

    Concurrent reads and writes to the same underlying Map can
    generate deadlocks, even with a single writer. Berkeley DB detects
    such deadlocks and "kills" one locker (iterator or transaction) to
    resolve it. For non-iterator access, Freeze handles this situation
    and retries transparently. When using iterators, a DeadlockException
    is raised to the application, which is responsible for closing the
    affected iterator(s) or transaction, and retrying.

    Serialized access or concurrent reads never produce deadlocks.

    In C++, the copy constructor and assignment operator of Freeze Map
    iterators duplicate the source iterator. When the source iterator
    is non-const, the duplicate iterator will use the same transaction.
    This transaction is committed only when its last associated iterator
    is closed (i.e., destroyed or assigned end()).

    In both C++ and Java, write operations that are not within a user-
    controlled transaction automatically close all open iterators
    in the target Map. This reduces the likelihood of self-deadlocks.
  
 - Freeze Evictor update:

   Freeze Evictors are now created directly using a static createEvictor
   function:

    C++: Freeze::EvictorPtr
         Freeze::createEvictor(const Ice::CommunicatorPtr& communicator, 
                               const std::string& envName, 
                               const std::string& dbName,
                               const std::vector<IndexPtr> indices = 
                                     std::vector<IndexPtr>(), 
                               bool createDb = true);

    Java (in class Freeze.Util): 
         public static Evictor
         createEvictor(Ice.Communicator communicator, 
                       String envName, 
                       String dbName,
                       Index[] indices, 
                       boolean createDb);

   The persistence strategies have been removed. 

   Ice objects are now saved by a background thread, controlled by
   the following configuration variables.

     - Freeze.Evictor.<envName>.<dbName>.SaveSizeTrigger: as soon as
       SaveSizeTrigger objects have been created, modified or
       destroyed, the background thread wakes up to save them. When set
       to a negative value, there is no size trigger. Defaults to 10.

     - Freeze.Evictor.<envName>.<dbName>.SavePeriod: the saving thread
       wakes up every SavePeriod ms and saves any created, modified or
       destroyed object. When set to 0, there is no periodic wake up.
       Defaults to 1 minute (60,000 ms).

     - Freeze.Evictor.<envName>.<dbName>.MaxTxSize: the saving thread
       saves objects (facets) using transactions. MaxTxSize sets the 
       maximum number of objects saved by a single transaction.
       Defaults to 10 * SaveSizeTrigger; if the provided or default
       value is negative, the actual value is set to 100.
 
    And instead of saving full objects, Freeze now saves on a per facet
    basis -- but still loads complete objects (with all their facets).
    Once a persistent object has been created using the Freeze Evictor,
    it is possible to add or remove persistent facets to this object
    using the following new Evictor operations:
  
      void addFacet(Ice::Identity identity, Ice::FacetPath facet, 
                    Object servant);
      void removeFacet(Ice::Identity identity, Ice::FacetPath facet);
      void removeAllFacets(Ice::Identity identity);

    When saving an object (facet), the background saving thread locks 
    this object. In Java, it locks the object itself; in C++, the object 
    is expected to implement IceUtil::AbstractMutex. Naturally the
    application must use the same synchronization to access the
    persistent state of the object.
 
    The EvictorIterator also changed slightly: the destroy operation
    has been removed. More importantly, identities are now retrieved
    in batch (internally) and the application can request that
    the corresponding servants be loaded. This is achieved with
    the new parameters of Evictor::getIterator:

      EvictorIterator getIterator(int batchSize, bool loadServants);

    You can also define Evictor indices for fast secondary key 
    lookups: see the Freeze/phonebook demo.

 - Freeze now requires Berkeley DB 4.1. It no longer compiles with older
   Berkeley DB releases.

   With Visual C++, you need to use the same project directory
   settings when building Berkeley DB and Ice. In particular, if you
   build Ice with STLPort, you need to build Berkeley DB with the same
   STLPort.

 - Added Freeze hot backup demo.

- Added new C++ AbstractMutex class, and helper templates
  (AbstractMutexI, AbstractMutexReadI, AbstractMutexWriteI) to easily
  implement AbstractMutex using Mutex, RecMutex, Monitor or
  RWRecMutex.

- Fixed a bug in the implementation of StaticMutex on Windows, which
  could result in a crash at exit.

- Added Ice.UDP.RcvSize and Ice.UDP.SndSize properties. These
  properties control the size of the UDP receive and send buffers as
  well as controlling the maximum size of a datagram invocation. If a
  datagram exceeds the configured size, the Ice run time throws a
  DatagramLimitException. (Note that, on the receiving size, detection
  of this condition is dependent on the local UDP implementation --
  some UDP implementations silently drop datagrams that are too large
  to fit into the receive buffer instead of reporting the error or
  delivering a truncated datagram.)

- Added Ice.Warn.Datagrams. This property prints a warning on the
  server side if a DatagramLimitException is thrown.

- Added Ice.MessageSizeMax property. This property controls the
  maximum message size accepted by the Ice protocol in kiloBytes. The
  default value is 1024 (1 MB).

- Fixed a number of incorrect property settings in the config files
  for the demos.

- Added new property: Ice.Trace.Slicing. When set to a value > 0,
  unknown exception and class types that are sliced emit a warning.

- Added destroyOnInterrupt() to the Application class.
  destroyOnInterrupt() is now the default behavior, because
  shutdownOnInterrupt() only shuts down the server side of an
  application, and therefore doesn't work with pure clients.

- ObjectAdapter::removeServantLocator() no longer exists. The life
  cycle of servant locators that are registered with an object adapter
  ends when the adapter is destroyed.

- Changed Ice::ServantLocator::deactivate to be passed the category
  for which a servant locator is being deactivated.

- Added --noindex option to slice2docbook to suppress generation of
  index pages for pdf version of documentation.

- Changed the behavior of Freeze::Map::insert to match the insert
  behavior on associative containers in the C++ standard: if the
  element is already there, it is not updated. Added Freeze::Map::put
  function, to insert or replace an element, like the old insert. This
  corresponds to the behavior of Berkeley DB's DB->put().

- Added a test to the Slice parser to complain if an operation on a
  local interface or class has an exception specification.

- Added a test to the property parsing code to print a warning on
  stderr if a property is not recognized. This prevents silly typos,
  such as "Ice.config=MyFile" (instead of "Ice.Config=MyFile") from
  slipping through undetected.

- Changed the mapping of the Slice byte type: Ice::Byte is now a
  typedef for unsigned char. (Previously, Ice::Byte was a typedef to
  char.) This change guarantees that byte values are always in the
  range 0..255 (instead of either -128..127 or 0..255, depending on
  the CPU architecture). This change also permits function overloading
  for Ice::Byte and char (which can be useful if you use both strings
  and byte sequences).

- Changed the python code for printing output from test clients, so
  that you get each line as it comes.

Changes since version 1.1.0
---------------------------

- Fixed a bug in IceXML that prevented successful extraction of
  strings containing 8-bit characters.

- Added support for a default object factory, similar to the semantics
  of servant locators. Specifically, a factory registered with an
  empty type id is invoked when a type-specific factory cannot be
  found.

- Added Linux/SPARC port from Ferris McCormick.

- Fixed a bug where a daemonized Ice::Application wouldn't shutdown
  properly.

- Added support for user-defined variables in IcePack service and
  server descriptors.

- Fixed server-side bug with batch oneways or batch datagrams.

- Fixed a performance problem in Glacier which would occur when using
  message batching.

- Portability fix in src/IceSSL/OpenSSLPluginI.cpp.

- config/Make.rules now checks that mkshlib is defined.

- src/IceUtil/CtrlCHandler.cpp now handles (ignores) EINTR returned by
  sigwait.

- Added DB_PRIVATE flag to DBEnv->open() on Linux, allowing Ice to use
  the Berkeley DB library included with RedHat 9.

Changes since version 1.0.1
---------------------------

- Added support for Visual Studio .NET 2003 aka VC 7.1

- In IceUtil, all "try" and "timed" functions now return false when
  the resource could not be acquired (i.e., an expected failure). The
  "Try" from "timedTry" functions was removed, and for consistency the
  functions trylock, readlock and writelock were renamed to tryLock,
  readLock and writeLock.

- Update to the library versioning scheme:

  On Windows, only the major and minor version are now used, for
  example: ice11d.dll (11d means 1.1 debug). In 1.0.x, the patch level
  was included in the version string, for example ice101d.dll.

  On Unix, the internal name (soname) is now constructed as
  lib<name>.so.<major version><minor version>, for example
  libIce.so.11 (for Ice 1.1.x). This internal name identifies a
  symbolic link to lib<name>.so.<full version>, for example:
  libIce.so.11 -> libIce.so.1.1.0. In 1.0.x, the internal name was set
  to the actual shared library file name, lib<name>.so.<full version>.

- Ice now implements slicing for exceptions and classes: if a process
  receives an exception or class that is of a more derived type than
  the receiver understands, the exception or class is automatically
  sliced. (Previously, this situation resulted in an exception.)

- Class factories are no longer necessary for non-abstract classes
  (that is, for classes that do not have operations). For non-abstract
  classes, the necessary factories are automatically installed by the
  Ice run time. If you have existing code that implements factories
  for non-abstract classes, you can simply delete that code.  Note
  that for abstract classes (that is, classes with operations), it is
  necessary to install a factory for each abstract class, exactly as
  in version 1.0.x.

- User exception factories and user exception factory managers no
  longer exist. The factories for user exceptions are now
  automatically installed by the Ice run time. If you have existing
  code that implements user exception factories, you can simply delete
  it.

- Fixed a bug in the Slice parser: the semantic check to see whether
  an identifier introduced into a scope has changed meaning was too
  stringent.

- If a client receives a derived exception for which it does not have
  a user exception factory installed, the client receives the
  exception sliced to a known base exception. In 1.0.x, the client
  would have received NoUserExceptionFactoryException, an exception
  that no longer exists in 1.1.x.

- Fixed a bug with connections being closed even though they have
  outstanding batch requests.

- Fixed bug in the WIN32 icepatch client. The removal of orphaned
  files didn't take into account that WIN32 file names are not case
  sensitive.

- New Ice.Nohup property: when its value is >0, shutdownOnInterrupt()
  in Application will ignore SIGHUP on Unix and CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT on
  Windows.

- Updated Application class: 

  * The default behavior is now shutdownOnInterrupt().

  * Removed the member function defaultInterrupt().
 
- Removed Communicator::signalShutdown(): Ice is not using signal
  handlers anymore, so Communicator::shutdown() can be used all the
  time.

- Added IceUtil::CtrlCHandler: a class that provides portable handling
  of CTRL+C and CTRL+C-like signals,

- Added IceUtil::StaticMutex, for simple, non-recursive, statically
  allocated and initialized mutexes.

- Updated Mutex, RecMutex and RWRecMutex APIs: lock and unlock now
  return void, and trylock returns a bool that indicates whether the
  mutex was acquired or not. Also added new member functions to LockT,
  TryLockT, RLockT, TryLockT, WLockT, TryWLockT: acquire(),
  tryAcquire(), release(), acquired() and more.

- Removed dependency on E2FSPROGS for UUID generation. On Unix, UUIDs
  are now generated directly with /dev/urandom.

- Added support for `env' XML element in IcePack descriptors to allow
  setting environment variables.

- Fixed a bug in the Slice parser: the semantic check to see whether
  an identifier introduced into a scope has changed meaning was too
  stringent.

- Fixed integer parsing bugs in the C++ XML stream class.

- Changed glacier router to send all requests from a separate
  thread. Previously, only requests forwarded as batch would be sent
  from a separate thread.

- Added support for SPARC/Solaris with the Sun C++ 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5
  compilers (32 and 64 bit). See INSTALL.SOLARIS for details.

- Replaced the Freeze::EvictorPersistenceMode enumeration with the
  interface Freeze::PersistenceStrategy.

- Added support for GCC 2.95.3.

- Several incompatible IceStorm changes:

  * Moved the subscribe and unsubscribe operations to the Topic
    interface.

  * Added an object adapter to host publisher objects, and hence a new
    configuration property IceStorm.Publish.Endpoints.

- Added dynamic thread pools, i.e., thread pools that grow and shrink
  based on a calculated load factor. Please see the section about
  thread pools in the manual for further details.

- Structs and sequences which hold other structs or sequences are now
  legal dictionary key types, as long as such nested structs or
  sequences are (recursively) legal.

- The connection timeout is now also used when connections are
  closed. This avoid hanging processes if the peer misbehaves, or if
  asynchronous methods invocations don't return.

- In some cases, communicator destruction could result in a
  NullHandleException. This has been fixed. Now a
  CommunicatorDestroyedException is raised.

- A monitor now holds the mutex lock while signaling a condition
  variable. Otherwise it's possible that the condition variable is
  destroyed before the signaling call returns, resulting in undefined
  behavior. The performance difference is minimal, hardly measurable.

- Further performance improvements with respect to latency.

- Added demo/Ice/throughput, which can be used to measure the transfer
  time of large sequences.

- Fixed a bug in the slice2cpp code generator: if a class was forward
  declared and used as a class member, but the definition of the class
  was not supplied in the same Slice compilation unit, invalid code
  was generated.

- Inlined most operators in IceUtil::Time for performance reasons.

- Added IceUtil::ThreadControl::isAlive(). This function is useful for
  implementing a non-blocking join().

- Added IceUtil::ThreadControl::id() member function.

- The scope of IceUtil::Thread::ThreadId has been changed to
  IceUtil::ThreadId. This is the type returned by both Thread::id()
  and ThreadControl::id().

- Joining with a thread more than once, joining with a detached
  thread, or detaching a detached thread now have undefined
  behavior. (Previously, doing any of these things raised an
  exception.)

- Added timestamps to the default Ice logger. You can enable
  timestamps by setting the `Ice.Logger.Timestamp' property to a value
  larger than zero. By default timestamps are disabled.

- Added several conversion functions to IceUtil::Time: toString,
  toSeconds, toMilliSeconds, toMicroSeconds.

- Fixed a bug in Freeze::DBEnvironment which caused the sync method to
  hang.

- Improved IceBox service deactivation. Instead of successively
  stopping a service and destroying its communicator, services are now
  all stopped first and then their communicators are destroyed.

- Modified the Ice protocol to marshal sizes more efficiently.  Sizes
  less than 255 now require a single byte whereas previously, sizes
  between 127 and 254 required five bytes.

- Modified the Ice protocol to fix a problem with compression. The
  compressed message types have been removed, and a field has been
  added to the message header indicating compression status.

- Added version negotiation to the Ice protocol. This permits future
  protocol extensions to be added without breaking interoperability
  with older deployed clients and servers. Unfortunately, doing this
  broke compatibility with the existing protocol so, when upgrading to
  this version, you must make sure that clients and servers use the
  same version of libIce.so.

- Added a magic number to the Ice protocol. All Ice protocol messages
  have 'I', 'c', 'e', 'P' (encoded as ASCII) in the first four bytes.
  This is useful to allow protocol analyzers to recognize Ice
  messages.

- Changed the encoding of encapsulations. An encapsulation now looks
  like:

	size (4 bytes)
	major version number (1 byte)
	minor version number (1 byte)
	data (n bytes)

  The size includes the count of bytes for the size and versions, so
  the value of size is n + 6.

- Added -v and -e options to stringified UDP endpoints. -v sets the
  protocol version and -e sets the encoding version. (The current
  version for both protocol and encoding is 1.0.)

- Compatibility fixes for GCC 2.96.

- Added `option' and `vm-option' elements to IcePack server
  descriptors. These elements are used to pass command line options to
  server processes.

- Added scandir() and alphasort() for Sun-OS and other Unix systems
  that do not have these BSD calls.

Changes since version 1.0.0
---------------------------

- Added --header-ext and --source-ext command-line options to
  slice2cpp and slice2freeze. These permit setting header and
  source file extensions for C++ other than the default `h' and
  `cpp' file extensions.

- Added the macro ICE_INT64 as a portable wrapper for long long
  constants.

- Added support for Xerces 2.2.0.

- Added support for OpenSSL 0.97a.

- Added OPENSSL_FLAGS to several Makefiles that were missing it.

- Changed signature of IceUtil::Time::milliSeconds() to
  IceUtil::Int64, to avoid overflows.

- Renamed Lock and TryLock templates to LockT and TryLockT, to avoid
  compilation problems with Sun Forte 6.2.

- Fixed a bug with throwing exceptions in AMD calls after invoking
  ice_response().

- Fixed a bug with throwing exceptions in AMI from within
  ice_response().

- For posix threads, PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE_NP is now only used if
  __linux__ is defined. Otherwise, PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE is used.

- The EPROTO error code is now only used if it is defined (such as
  on Linux).

- Several other changes that make Ice for C++ more portable.

- Updated SSL test certificates. The old ones have expired.
