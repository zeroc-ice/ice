Changes since version 1.0.0
---------------------------

- Added the macro ICE_INT64 as a portable wrapper for long long
  constants.

- Added support for Xerces 2.2.0.

- Added support for OpenSSL 0.97a.

- Added OPENSSL_FLAGS to several Makefiles that were missing it.

- Changed signature of IceUtil::Time::milliSeconds() to
  IceUtil::Int64, to avoid overflows.

- Renamed Lock and TryLock templates to LockT and TryLockT, to avoid
  compilation problems with Sun Forte 6.2.

- Fixed a bug with throwing exceptions in AMD calls after invoking
  ice_response().

- Fixed a bug with throwing exceptions in AMI from within
  ice_response().

- For posix threads, PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE_NP is now only used if

- The EPROTO error code is now only used if it is defined (such as
  on Linux).

- Several other changes that make Ice for C++ more portable.

- Updated SSL test certificates. The old ones have expired.
