Changes since version 1.0.1
---------------------------

- Compatibility fixes for GCC 2.96.

- Added `option' and `vm-option' elements to IcePack server
  descriptors. These elements are used to pass command line options 
  to server processes.

Changes since version 1.0.0
---------------------------

- Added --header-ext and --source-ext command-line options to
  slice2cpp and slice2freeze. These permit setting header and
  source file extensions for C++ other than the default `h' and
  `cpp' file extensions.

- Added the macro ICE_INT64 as a portable wrapper for long long
  constants.

- Added support for Xerces 2.2.0.

- Added support for OpenSSL 0.97a.

- Added OPENSSL_FLAGS to several Makefiles that were missing it.

- Changed signature of IceUtil::Time::milliSeconds() to
  IceUtil::Int64, to avoid overflows.

- Renamed Lock and TryLock templates to LockT and TryLockT, to avoid
  compilation problems with Sun Forte 6.2.

- Fixed a bug with throwing exceptions in AMD calls after invoking
  ice_response().

- Fixed a bug with throwing exceptions in AMI from within
  ice_response().

- For posix threads, PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE_NP is now only used if
  __linux__ is defined. Otherwise, PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE is used.

- The EPROTO error code is now only used if it is defined (such as
  on Linux).

- Several other changes that make Ice for C++ more portable.

- Updated SSL test certificates. The old ones have expired.
