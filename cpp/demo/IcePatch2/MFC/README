This demo illustrates how to use MFC to create a simple IcePatch2
client application.

The IcePatch2 server must be running before the client can patch, but
a data directory must be prepared in order to run the server. The
contents of the data directory are what the client will receive during
the patch process. For convenience, this example uses its own source
files as the data to be patched.

Assuming that the current working directory is demo/IcePatch2/MFC, you
can prepare the data files with the following command:

$ icepatch2calc .

Next, start the IcePatch2 server:

$ icepatch2server --IcePatch2.Endpoints="tcp -h 127.0.0.1 -p 10000" .

The last argument (".") tells the server to use the current directory
as its data directory.

Before we start the patch client, we must first create an empty
directory where the downloaded files will be placed. For example, you
can use:

$ mkdir $HOME/icepatch_download

Now you can start the IcePatch2 client:

$ patch --IcePatch2.Endpoints="tcp -h 127.0.0.1 -p 10000"

Click the "..." button to the right of the Patch Directory field and
select an empty directory you just created. Then click the "Patch"
button to begin the patch process.
