Unix Note:

For icebox to be able to find the library containing the service, you
must add the current directory to your shared library search path
(e.g., LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux, SHLIB_PATH on HP-UX, etc.).
Alternatively, you can copy libHelloService.so to a directory that is
already in the search path.
