Users of Unix platforms should read "Unix Note" at the end of this
file before continuing.

To run the demo, first start the IcePack service:

$ icepacknode --Ice.Config=config --warn

In a separate window:

$ icepackadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "application add 'application.xml'"
$ client

This will deploy the servers described in the file "application.xml"
and start the client.

Messages will be displayed in the IcePack service window.

Unix Note:

In order to allow the node to start the IceBox service included in
this example, you must add the current directory to your shared
library search path (e.g., LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux, SHLIB_PATH on
HP-UX, etc.). Alternatively, you can copy the shared library for the
example IceBox service (i.e., the file libHelloService.so) to a
directory that is already in your search path.
