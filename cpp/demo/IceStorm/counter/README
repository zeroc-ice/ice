To run the demo, start the IceStorm service:

$ icebox --Ice.Config=config.icebox

This configuration assumes there is a subdirectory named db in the
current working directory.

In a separate window:

$ server

In another window:

$ client

Press 'i' and 'd' to increment and decrement the counter. You can also
start more clients in other windows and observe that each is
initialized and subsequently updated with the current counter value.
