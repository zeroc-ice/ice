To run the demo, first start the IceGrid service:

$ icegridnode --Ice.Config=config.grid

In a separate window:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e \
    "application add 'application.xml'"
$ client

This will deploy the application described in the file
"application.xml" and start the client.

The client makes an invocation on the "pricing" well-known object to
retrieve the prefered currencies of the server. The client sets up a
context to indicate its prefered currency to the replica group
filter. The replica group filter filters out servers that don't match.

You can execute multiple times the client to ensure it doesn't always
talk to the same server. The client should always talk to a server
that supports its prefered currency.

You can edit config.client to change or comment out the client's
prefered currency.
