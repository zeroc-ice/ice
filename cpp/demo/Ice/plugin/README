This demo illustrates how to write and configure a simple Ice plugin
as well as a Ice Logger plugin.

To run the demo, first start the server:

$ server

In a separate window, start the client:

$ client

Both the client and server use a custom logger which is loaded as
a logger plugin. The server also uses a plugin to implement the
servant for this demo.

Please look in the client and sever configuration files to see the
plugin configuration.

Note that in linux the plugin directory should be in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
