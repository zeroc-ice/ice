This demo illustrates how to implement and use string converters
with Ice. In this demo the client represents an application that
uses ISO-Latin-1 as it's character set and the server, an application
that just uses plain UTF-8.

The demo sends and reecives the string "Über" which in Latin-1 is
"\374ber" and in UTF-8 is "\303\274ber".

To run the demo, first start the server:

$ server

In a separate window, start the client:

$ client
