Demos in this directory:

- minimal

  This demo illustrates a minimal Ice application.

- MFC

  Shows how to use Ice in conjunction with the Microsoft Foundation
  Classes.

- bidir

  This demo shows how to use bi-directional connections for
  callbacks. This is typically used if the server cannot open a
  connection to the client to send callbacks, for example, because
  firewalls block incoming connections to the client.

- callback

  A simple callback demo that illustrates how a client can pass a
  proxy to a server, invoke an operation in the server, and the server
  call back into an object provided by the client as part of that
  invocation.

- hello

  This demo illustrates how to invoke ordinary (twoway) operations, as
  well as how to invoke oneway operations, use datagrams, secure
  invocations, and how to used batched invocations.

- invoke

  This demo illustrates the use of the Ice streaming API.

- latency

  A simple latency test that measures the basic call dispatch delay of
  Ice.

- nested

  A demo to illustrate how nested callbacks work, and how the size of
  the thread pool affects the maximum nesting depth.

- throughput

  A simple throughput demo that allows you to send sequences of
  various types between client and server and to measure the maximum
  bandwidth that can be achieved using serialized synchronous
  requests.

- value

  This demo shows how to use classes, class factories, and the
  difference between local and remote invocations of class operations.

- session

  This demo shows how to use sessions to clean up client-specific
  resources in a server after the client shuts down or crashes.
