This demo shows how to use bidirectional connections for callbacks.
This is typically used if the server cannot open a connection to the
client to send callbacks, for example, because firewalls block
incoming connections to the client.

First follow the instructions from the C++ Ice bidir demo README to
start the server.

Build and deploy the demo using "Deploy bidir" from the "Build" menu.

Start the "Ice Bidir Demo" application from the Windows Start screen
or right click on the project and select Debug -> Start new instance.
