<para>
A stringified proxy consists of an identity, proxy options, and an
optional object adapter identifier or endpoint list. White space
(the space, tab (<literal>\t</literal>), line feed (<literal>\n</literal>),
and carriage return (<literal>\r</literal>) characters) act as token
delimiters; if a white space character appears as part of a component
of a stringified proxy (such as the identity), it must be quoted or
escaped as described below.
</para>
<para>
A proxy containing
an identity with no endpoints, or an identity with an object adapter
identifier, represents an indirect proxy that will be resolved using the
&Ice; locator (see the <literal>Ice.Default.Locator</literal> property).
</para>
<para>
Proxy options configure the invocation mode:

</informaltable>
<para>
The proxy options <literal>-t</literal>, <literal>-o</literal>,
<literal>-O</literal>, <literal>-d</literal>, and <literal>-D</literal>
are mutually exclusive.
</para>
<para>
The object identity <replaceable>identity</replaceable> is structured
as <literal>[<replaceable>category</replaceable>/]<replaceable>name
</replaceable></literal>, where the <replaceable>category</replaceable>
component and slash separator are optional. If
<replaceable>identity</replaceable> contains white space or either of the
characters <literal>:</literal> or <literal>@</literal>, it must be enclosed
in single or double quotes. The <replaceable>category</replaceable> and
<replaceable>name</replaceable> components are UTF-8 strings that use the
encoding described below. Any occurrence of a slash (<literal>/</literal>)
in <replaceable>category</replaceable> or <replaceable>name</replaceable>
must be escaped with a backslash (i.e., <literal>\/</literal>).
</para>
<para>
The <replaceable>facet</replaceable> argument of the <literal>-f</literal>
option represents a facet name. If <replaceable>facet</replaceable>
contains white space, it must be enclosed in single or double quotes. A
facet name is a UTF-8 string that uses the encoding described
below.
</para>
<para>
The object adapter identifier <replaceable>adapter_id</replaceable>
is a UTF-8 string that uses the encoding described below. If
<replaceable>adapter_id</replaceable> contains white space, it must
be enclosed in single or double quotes.
</para>
<para>
Single quotes can be used to prevent white space characters from being interpreted
as delimiters, and to escape the special meaning of the backslash (<literal>\</literal>)
character. Within single quotes, the only character that retains its special
meaning is the single quote itself; a backslash can be used to prevent interpretation
of a single quote as a closing quote, for example: <literal>'a string with a \' quote'</literal>.
</para>
<para>
Double quotes prevent interpretation of white space characters as delimiters and prevent
interpretation of a single quote as an opening or closing quote. For example:
<literal>"a string with a ' quote"</literal>. However, escape sequences such as <literal>\b</literal>
are interpreted within double quotes.
</para>
<para>
UTF-8 strings are encoded using ASCII characters for the ordinal
range 32-126 (inclusive). Characters outside this range must be encoded
using escape sequences (<literal>\b</literal>,
<literal>\f</literal>, <literal>\n</literal>, <literal>\r</literal>,
<literal>\t</literal>) or octal notation (e.g., <literal>\007</literal>).
A double quote can be escaped using a backslash, as can the backslash itself (<literal>\\</literal>).
</para>
<para>
If endpoints are specified, they must be separated with a colon
(<literal>:</literal>) and formatted as described in
<link linkend="endpoints" endterm="endpoints.title">Endpoints</link>. The order of
endpoints in the stringified proxy is not necessarily the order in
which connections are attempted during binding: when a stringified proxy is
converted into a proxy instance, the endpoint list is randomized as a form
of load balancing.
</para>
<para>
If the <literal>-s</literal> option is specified, only those endpoints that
support secure invocations are considered during binding. If no valid
endpoints are found, the application receives
<literal>Ice::NoEndpointException</literal>.
</para>
<para>
Otherwise, if the <literal>-s</literal> option is not specified, the endpoint
list is ordered so that non-secure endpoints have priority over secure
endpoints during binding. In other words, connections are attempted on all
non-secure endpoints before any secure endpoints are attempted.
</para>
<para>
If an unknown option is specified, or the stringified proxy is malformed,
the application receives <literal>Ice::ProxyParseException</literal>. If
an endpoint is malformed, the application receives
<literal>Ice::EndpointParseException</literal>.
</para>

<para>
An endpoint list comprises one or more endpoints separated by a colon
(<literal>:</literal>). An endpoint has the following format:
<cmdsynopsis>
<arg choice=plain><replaceable>protocol</replaceable></arg>
<arg rep=repeat><replaceable>option</replaceable></arg>
</cmdsynopsis>
The supported protocols are <literal>tcp</literal>, <literal>udp</literal>,
<literal>ssl</literal>, and <literal>default</literal>. If
<literal>default</literal> is used, it is replaced by the value of the
<literal>Ice.Default.Protocol</literal> property. If an endpoint is
malformed, or an unknown protocol is specified, the application receives
<literal>Ice::EndpointParseException</literal>.
</para>
<note>
<para>
The <literal>ssl</literal> protocol is only available if the IceSSL plug-in
is installed.
</para>

The protocols and their supported options are described in the sections that
