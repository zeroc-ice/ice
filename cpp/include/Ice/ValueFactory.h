         * format with which the value was marshaled: If the value uses the "sliced" format, Ice ascends the class
         * hierarchy until it finds a type that is recognized by a factory, or it reaches the least-derived type. If no
         * factory is found that can create an instance, the run time throws MarshalException. If the value uses
         * the "compact" format, Ice immediately raises MarshalException. The following order is used to locate a
         * factory for a type: <ol> <li>The Ice run-time looks for a factory registered specifically for the type.</li>
         * <li>If no instance has been created, the Ice run-time looks for the default factory, which is registered with
         * an empty type ID.</li> <li>If no instance has been created by any of the preceding steps, the Ice run-time
         * looks for a factory generated by the Slice compiler.</li>
