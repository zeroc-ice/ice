Overview
==

This is the API reference for the C++98 mapping. We provide a [tag file](../icecpp98.tag)
if you would like to include links to this documentation in your own Doxygen projects.

Refer to the [Ice Manual](https://doc.zeroc.com/ice/3.7/introduction) for more
information on the C++98 mapping. An API reference for the [C++11 mapping](../cpp11/index.html)
is also available.
