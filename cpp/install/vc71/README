Installer for Visual Studio .NET 2003 aka VC 7.1:
------------------------------------------------

Installers for Visual Studio .NET 2003 can be created by
modifying the Visual Studio .NET 2002 installer projects as
follows:

(1) Copy all the files in the vc70 directory to this directory,
except the README.

(2) Open the vc71\vc70.sln solution and remove all VC_CRT.msm,
VC_CRT_IO.msm and VC_STL.msm. They are mostly in the Runtime
Merge Module projects.

(3) Add msvcr71.dll and msvcr71.dll to the Application 
Folder\bin folder for ThirdParty and Ice. Visual Studio offers 
you to use Merge Modules instead ... say no as these 
Visual Studio .NET 2003 Merge Modules have no relocatable 
folder.
These DLLs can be found in various directories, for example:
 C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\
    Visual Studio .NET Professional 2003 - English

(4) Open (and save) demo\demo.sln with Visual Studio .NET 2003 
to convert it to the 2003 format.

(5) In the Ice and ThirdParty projects, replace ".NET 2002" by 
".NET 2003", either using Visual Studio or by opening the 
corresponding .vdproj files with a text editor.

(6) (Optional) Add the IceCS project utput to the Ice project to
include Ice for C# and Ice for Visual Basic in the installer.

Then refer to the vc70\README for further information on
these installer projects.
