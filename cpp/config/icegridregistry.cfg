# Client object adapter: listens on the loopback interface by default.
#
# IANA-registered TCP ports for the IceGrid registry:
# - 4061 (insecure)
# - 4062 (secure, using SSL)
#
# These endpoints must be accessible to Ice clients and servers as
# well as the IceGrid administrative utilities.
#
# To listen on an additional interface, add an additional endpoint with
# -h <name | IP address>, or remove -h localhost to listen on all
# interfaces.

#
# Server and Internal object adapters: listen on the loopback
# interface using an OS-assigned port number.
#
# The Server endpoints must be accessible to Ice servers deployed on
# IceGrid nodes or to Ice servers using IceGrid dynamic registration.
# The Internal endpoints must be accessible to IceGrid nodes.
#
# To listen on an additional interface, add an additional endpoint with
# -h <name | IP address>, or remove -h localhost to listen on all
# interfaces. Note that access to these endpoints can pose a security
# risk (remote code execution) and therefore these endpoints should be
# secured. See the Ice manual for more information.
