This demo contains a client that communicates with the Glacier2 chat
demo provided in the full Ice distribution (demo/Glacier2/chat). You
must build the Ice demo before you can run this demo.

To run the demo, change to the Ice demo directory and start the chat
server:

$ server

In a separate window, change to the Ice demo directory and modify the
file config.glacier2 as follows: change the Glacier2.Client.Endpoints
property to use a tcp endpoint. In addition, if the client is run
outside the Glacier2 router's host, the router must also listen on a
public interface instead of the loopback interface.

For most configurations the property can be changed from:

Glacier2.Client.Endpoints=ssl -p 10005 -h 127.0.0.1

to:

Glacier2.Client.Endpoints=tcp -p 10005

Next, start the Glacier2 router:

$ glacier2router --Ice.Config=config.glacier2

Finally, start the Ice-E client:

$ java Client
