        A servant locator is called by an object adapter to
        locate a servant that is not found in its active servant map.

        def locate(self, curr):
            """
            Called before a request is dispatched if a
            servant cannot be found in the object adapter's active servant
            map. Note that the object adapter does not automatically insert
            the returned servant into its active servant map. This must be
            done by the servant locator implementation, if this is desired.
            locate can throw any user exception. If it does, that exception
            is marshaled back to the client. If the Slice definition for the
            corresponding operation includes that user exception, the client
            receives that user exception; otherwise, the client receives
            UnknownUserException.
            If locate throws any exception, the Ice run time does not
            call finished.
            If you call locate from your own code, you
            must also call finished when you have finished using the
            servant, provided that locate returned a non-null servant;
            otherwise, you will get undefined behavior if you use
            servant locators such as the Freeze Evictor.
            Arguments:
            curr -- Information about the current operation for which a servant is required.
            Returns a tuple containing the following:
            _retval -- The located servant, or null if no suitable servant has been found.
            cookie -- A "cookie" that will be passed to finished.
            Throws:
            UserException -- The implementation can raise a UserException and the run time will marshal it as the result of the invocation.
            """
            raise NotImplementedError("method 'locate' not implemented")

        def finished(self, curr, servant, cookie):
            """
            Called by the object adapter after a request has been
            made. This operation is only called if locate was called
            prior to the request and returned a non-null servant. This
            operation can be used for cleanup purposes after a request.
            finished can throw any user exception. If it does, that exception
            is marshaled back to the client. If the Slice definition for the
            corresponding operation includes that user exception, the client
            receives that user exception; otherwise, the client receives
            UnknownUserException.
            If both the operation and finished throw an exception, the
            exception thrown by finished is marshaled back to the client.
            Arguments:
            curr -- Information about the current operation call for which a servant was located by locate.
            servant -- The servant that was returned by locate.
            cookie -- The cookie that was returned by locate.
            Throws:
            UserException -- The implementation can raise a UserException and the run time will marshal it as the result of the invocation.
