    Dispatch a request to the given servant method.

    This function is called by IcePy from an Ice server thread pool thread to dispatch a request to a servant method
    with the given arguments. The method's result is then sent back to IcePy using the provided callback.

    The method can return:
    - A direct result, which is immediately sent back.
    - A coroutine.
    - A future.

    If the result is a coroutine and the Ice communicator has a custom coroutine executor, the executor is used to
    execute the coroutine, and the resulting future is used to wait for the dispatch completion.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cb : IcePy.DispatchCallback
        The callback used to return the result or report an exception to IcePy.
    method : callable
        The servant method to invoke. This method is bound to the servant instance and takes the request parameters as
        arguments.
    args : list
        The request parameters.
