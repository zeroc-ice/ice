% ToStringMode   Summary of ToStringMode
%
% The central object in Ice. One or more communicators can be instantiated for an Ice application. Communicator
% instantiation is language-specific, and not specified in Slice code.

% ToStringMode Properties:
%   Unicode - Characters with ordinal values greater than 127 are kept as-is in the resulting string.
%   ASCII - Characters with ordinal values greater than 127 are encoded as universal character names in the resulting string: \\unnnn for BMP characters and \\Unnnnnnnn for non-BMP characters.
%   Compat - Characters with ordinal values greater than 127 are encoded as a sequence of UTF-8 bytes using octal escapes.
