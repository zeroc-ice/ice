% UnknownUserException   Summary of UnknownUserException
%
% An operation raised an incorrect user exception. This exception is raised if an operation raises a user exception
% that is not declared in the exception's throws clause. Such undeclared exceptions are not transmitted
% from the server to the client by the Ice protocol, but instead the client just gets an UnknownUserException.
% This is necessary in order to not violate the contract established by an operation's signature: Only local
% exceptions and user exceptions declared in the throws clause can be raised.
