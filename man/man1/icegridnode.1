.SH NAME

icegridnode - The IceGrid node server.

.SH SYNOPSIS

icegridnode [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION

An IceGrid node is a process that activates, monitors, and deactivates
registered server processes. You can run any number of nodes in a domain, but
typically there is one node per host. A node must be running on each host on
which servers are activated automatically, and nodes cannot run without an
IceGrid registry. The IceGrid node server is implemented by the icegridnode
executable. If you wish to run a registry and node in one process,
icegridnode is the executable you must use. Full documentation for icegridnode
