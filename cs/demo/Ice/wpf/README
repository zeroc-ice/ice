This demo illustrates how to write a Windows Presentation Foundation
(WPF) application which invokes ordinary (twoway) operations, as well
as how to make oneway, datagram, secure, and batched invocations.

To run the demo, first start the hello server:

$ cd ../hello
$ server.exe

In a separate window, start the WPF client:

$ client.exe
