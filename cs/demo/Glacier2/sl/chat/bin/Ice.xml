            Destroy the communicator.
            This operation calls shutdown
            implicitly.  Calling destroy cleans up memory, and shuts down
            this communicator's client functionality and destroys all object

            <summary>
            Wait until the application has called shutdown (or destroy).
            On the server side, this operation blocks the calling thread
            until all currently-executing operations have completed.
            On the client side, the operation simply block until another
            thread has called shutdown or destroy.
            
            A typical use of this operation is to call it
            from the main thread, which then waits until some other thread
            calls shutdown. After shut-down is complete, the main thread
            returns and can do some cleanup work before it finally calls
            destroy to shut down the client functionality, and then
            exits the application.

            For example,

            10000 creates a proxy that refers to the Ice object

            Installing a
            factory with an id for which a factory is already registered
            throws AlreadyRegisteredException.
            
            When unmarshaling an Ice object, the Ice run-time reads the
            most-derived type id off the wire and attempts to create an
            instance of the type using a factory. If no instance is created,
            either because no factory was found, or because all factories
            returned nil, the object is sliced to the next most-derived type
            and the process repeats. If no factory is found that can create an
            instance, the Ice run-time throws NoObjectFactoryException.
            
            The following order is used to locate a factory for a type:
            
            
            
            The Ice run-time looks for a factory registered
            specifically for the type.
            
            If no instance has been created, the Ice run-time looks
            for the default factory, which is registered with an empty type id.
            
            
            If no instance has been created by any of the preceding
            steps, the Ice run-time looks for a factory that may have been
            statically generated by the language mapping for non-abstract classes.

            Deprecated callback interface for AMI invocations. This is useful
            for applications that send asynchronous invocations that
            might not be sent for some time and, therefore, are
            queued in the Ice run time for transmission.
            The Ice run time calls ice_sent if an
            an AMI invocation cannot be written to the transport and was
            queued for later transmission. Applications that need to
            implement flow control for AMI invocations can implement
            this interface on the corresponding AMI callback object.

            Called before a request is dispatched if a

            map.
            Note that the object adapter does not automatically insert
            the returned servant into its active servant map. This must be
            done by the servant locator implementation, if this is desired.
            
            locate can throw any user exception. If it does, that exception
            is marshaled back to the client. If the Slice definition for the
            corresponding operation includes that user exception, the client
            receives that user exception; otherwise, the client receives
            UnknownUserException.
            
            If locate throws any exception, the Ice run time does not
            call finished.
            
            If you call locate from your own code, you
            must also call finished when you have finished using the
            servant, provided that locate returned a non-null servant;
            otherwise, you will get undefined behavior if you use

            This operation is only called if locate was called
            prior to the request and returned a non-null servant. This
            operation can be used for cleanup purposes after a request.
