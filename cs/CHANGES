Changes since version 2.1.2
---------------------------

- Fixed a bug in the slice2cs code generator: for sequences of
  Slice structs that used the class mapping, the generated code
  caused a run-time error.

- Fixed a bug in the slice2cs code generator: if an operation
  had a parameter named i or szx, incorrect code was generated
  in some cases.

- Fixed a bug in proxyToString() for bidirectional proxies.

- Added ice_communicator() to proxies. This function returns
  the communicator that was used to create the proxy.

- Added ice_toString() to proxies. This function returns
  the stringified proxy. This function can be more convenient
  to use than communicator.stringToProxy() because you do
  not need the communicator to stringify a proxy that way.

- Parsing a stringified proxy no longer completely fails if the proxy
  contains an endpoint type which is unknown to the Ice runtime as long
  as the proxy contains other endpoints which are known. A warning is
  printed for the unknown types that are encountered.

- Ice.ObjectImpl is now an abstract class that cannot be instantiated.
  This change should be transparent to application code.

Changes since version 2.1.1
---------------------------

- Fixed a bug with dynamic thread pools, where new threads were
  destroyed immediately after dispatch if <threadpool>.Size=1 and
  <threadpool>.SizeMax > 1.

- Added the configuration property Ice.Compression.Level to provide
  more control over the bzip2 algorithm used to compress Ice protocol
  messages.

- Fixed a bug in the code generator: incorrect code was generated
  if an operation used an exception from an unrelated module in
  its exception specification.

- Added constructors to for structures and classes to C# mapping to
  allow structures and classes to be created and initialized in
  a single statement.

Changes since version 2.1.0
---------------------------

- Modified the Ice marshaling engine so that references to Ice objects
  are released as soon as possible.

- Fixed a race condition in the Ice run time that could cause a
  NullPointerException during process shutdown on machines with
  more than one CPU.

- Added sequences of fixed-length elements to throughput demo.

- Fixed a bug that could cause an assert if connections could not be
  established in thread-per-connection mode.

- Added two new properties for controlling Active Connection
  Management (ACM). In prior releases ACM was governed by the property
  Ice.ConnectionIdleTime, which affected client- and server-side
  behavior. The new properties, Ice.ACM.Client and Ice.ACM.Server,
  now allow independent timeouts to be specified for client- and
  server-side ACM. Ice.ConnectionIdleTime is now deprecated.

- Reverted a change introduced in 2.1.0 in which retries were not
  attempted for oneway and batch oneway requests. Ice now behaves
  as it did in prior releases: if the connection associated with a
  oneway or batch oneway proxy is closed, an invocation on the proxy
  will transparently reestablish the connection. Please see the Ice
  manual for more information on the reliability of oneway and batch
  oneway reliability.

- Added -E option to the various Slice compilers to print preprocessor
  output on stdout.

- Fixed a bug in the option parsing for Ice tools such as slice2cpp,
  slice2java, slice2cs, etc. The option parser used to incorrectly
  complain about repeated options when in fact no option was
  repeated. Also changed the parser to permit options to follow an
  argument, so

      slice2cpp -I. x.ice

  and

      slice2cpp x.ice -I.

  are now equivalent.

Changes since version 2.0.0
---------------------------

- Fixed bug in the code generators for C# and VB: for sequences
  of structs and sequences of Object*, incorrect code was generated
  if a ["cs:collection"] or ["vb:collection"] metadata directive
  was used.

- We do not retry oneway or batch oneway requests anymore, except if
  there are problems during connection establishment. If we retry a
  oneway or batch oneway, previous oneways from the same batch, or
  previous oneways that are buffered by the IP stack implementation,
  are silently thrown away. This can lead to a situation where the
  latest oneway succeeds due to retry, but former oneways are
  discarded.

- Fixed a deadlock that could occur if a server cannot send data
  during connection validation.

- Fixed bug where marshalling would fail for sequences of integral
  types on big endian platforms.

- Fixed bug where connection establishment could raise a 
  System.Net.Sockets.SocketException instead of an Ice.SocketException.

- Added setDefaultContext() and getDefaultContext() to the
  Ice.Communicator interface. This allows a default context to be
  established on a communicator-wide basis. See section 29.9.3 in the
  doc.

  Added ice_defaultContext to Ice.ObjectPrx. This creates a new
  proxy that uses the default context established on the communicator.

- Overloaded the checkedCast member function of the generated PrxHelper
  classes to allow a trailing argument of type Ice::Context. This makes
  it possible to do stateful things that require a context in a
  servant locator's activate() method.

- Fixed a bug in slice2cs: incorrect code was generated if an interface
  was derived from a base interface in a different module and the base
  interface contained an AMD operation.

Changes since version 1.5.1
---------------------------

- The proxy returned by the object adapter operations addFacet and
  addFacetWithUUID did not contain the facet. This required the
  application to make an extra call to ice_newFacet in order to
  obtain the correct proxy. This has been fixed.

- Added the object adapter property <name>.PublishedEndpoints, which
  specifies endpoints to advertise in proxies created by the adapter.

- Fixed a bug with AMD exception handling, where it was possible that
  certain exceptions propagate out of ice_response() or
  ice_exception(), and therefore such exceptions were not handled
  properly.

- Exceptions raised while marshaling data for batch requests resulted
  in a connection deadlock. This has been fixed.

- Fixed a bug in slice2cs: the generated code was incorrect for
  dictionaries and structures containing a sequence, if that sequence
  was mapped to an array.

- Fixed tracing of operation mode.

- The escape prefix for Slice identifiers that are used by .NET
  framework classes has been changed from "_cs_" to "_Ice_".  For
  example, Slice "Add" now maps to C# "_Ice_Add" instead of "_cs_Add".

  In addition, the prefix is now case-insensitive, so Slice "add" now
  maps to C# "_Ice_add" whereas, previously, it mapped to C# "add".
  (These changes were necessary to preserve binary compatibility of
  slice2cs and slice2vb generated code.)

- The documentation has always stated that same-named constructs
  cannot be directly nested inside each other. (For example, a module
  `M' cannot contain a constant named `M'. The slice2cs compiler did
  not enforce this correctly up to now for modules containing
  constructs with the same name as the enclosing module.  This has
  been fixed and now results in a diagnostic.

- The slice2cs compiler now disallows Slice definitions at global
  scope: only modules can be defined at global scope. Everything else
  (constants, classes, interfaces, etc.) must be defined inside a
  module.

- Fixed a bug in the slice2cs code generator:
  
  ["cs:collection"] sequence<Object> S1;
  ["cs:collection"] sequence<Object*> S2;

  Sequences of Object or Object* caused incorrect code to be generated
  if they were marked as "cs:collection".

- Fixed a bug in the slice2cs code generator: for nested sequences,
  incorrect code was generated if both the inner and the outer
  sequence were mapped as arrays.

- Fixed a number of bugs in slice2cs that cause incorrect code to be
  generated if C# keywords were used as Slice identifiers.

- Fixed the and slice2cs compiler for operations with multiple
  exceptions in an exception specification: if an exception was a base
  of one or more other exceptions in the same exception specification,
  the code generator sometimes emitted the catch blocks in the
  marshaling and dispatch code in the wrong order. (This applied only
  to interfaces with an ["amd"] metadata directive.)

- Several demos used Slice classes where interfaces were more
  appropriate. This has been fixed.

- Ice.Util.initializeWithProperties() now correctly parses the command
  line arguments.

- New properties Ice.StdErr and Ice.StdOut to redirect the standard
  error and output streams of a process.

- Added test and demo for using Ice for C# with Glacier.

- Changed the slice2cs code generator to avoid generating empty
  namespaces.

Changes since version 1.5.0
---------------------------

- Compression is now supported for non-Windows platforms as well
  as on Windows.

- Fixed a bug in the slice2cs code generator: classes with multiple
  sequence members caused incorrect code to be generated.

- Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented correct connection
  establishment under Windows.

Changes since Alpha 2
---------------------

- Added support for generating checksums of Slice definitions,
  enabling peers to verify that they share the same client-server
  contract. See the manual for more information.

- Added support for Mono.

- The DLL that contains the Ice for C# run time has been renamed from
  Icicle.dll to icecs.dll.

- Added support for protocol compression.

- Added extensive documentation for the language mapping to
  "Distributed Programming with Ice" (http://www.zeroc.com/Ice-Manual.pdf).

- Added support for AMI and AMD.

- Removed "cs:array" directive for sequences. Sequences are now mapped
  to arrays by default. If you want a sequence to map to a container
  derived from System.Collections.CollectionBase, you need to use
  the "cs:collection" metadata directive.

- Added "cs:class" metadata directive for Slice structures. Without
  this directive, Slice structures map to C# structures. With this
  directive, Slice structures map to C# classes.

- Added a key pair to the distribution so the assembly has a strong
  name and can be added to the global assembly cache. If you want to
  use your own key pair, you can replace the contents of
  src/Ice/IcecsKey.snk with your own key pair. See
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconcreatingkeypairforuseincreatingstrongly-namedassembly.asp
  for more detail.

- The generated code is more efficient and smaller than it was
  previously.


Changes since Alpha 1
---------------------

- Changed the generate.cs code to look for slice2cs in
  ${SolutionDir}/bin.

- Added "cs:array" metadata directive for sequences.  Sequences with
  this directive are mapped to arrays instead of being derived from
  Collections.CollectionBase.

- Improved marshaling speed.
