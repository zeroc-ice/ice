Ice for C# currently does not support the following features of Ice
for C++:

- Protocol encryption

- Any of the Ice services (Freeze, Glacier2, etc.)

Protocol compression is supported. Note that, for compression to work,
libbz2 must be installed and in your %PATH% or $LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If
libbz2 cannot be found at run time, the Ice run time automatically
disables protocol compression. You can download bzip2 at
http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2.

Supported environments:

- Visual C# (Windows)

- Mono

See INSTALL.VISUAL_C# or INSTALL.MONO for installation information.
