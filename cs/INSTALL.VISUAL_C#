Build instructions
------------------

Ice for .NET has been built and tested with:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 SP1 and .NET Framework Version 4.0

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 SP1 and .NET Silverlight 5.0

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 and .NET Framework Version 4.5

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 SP1 and .NET Compact Framework Version 3.5 SP1

Unpack the archive. The .NET sources will be contained in the
Ice-@ver@\cs subdirectory.

You will need the Slice to C# translator and supporting executables
and libraries from Ice for C++. You can download a binary distribution
from the ZeroC web site, or you can build Ice for C++ yourself.

Binary distributions for the supported platforms are available at

  http://www.zeroc.com/download_beta.html

Follow these steps to build the source:

1) If you have not built Ice for C++ in the "cpp" subdirectory, set
   ICE_HOME to the directory of your Ice for C++ installation.
   For example:

   > set ICE_HOME=C:\Ice-@ver@

2) Change to the "cs" subdirectory of the Ice source distribution:

   > cd Ice-@ver@\cs

3) Open config\Make.rules.mak.cs and review the comments that describe
   the settings you can modify. For example, you may wish to enable
   optimization.

4) Run nmake:

   > nmake /f Makefile.mak

The tests and sample programs are built automatically. If you modify
the source code of a sample program, you can rebuild it using nmake.

You can also build the demos using the Visual Studio solution located
in demo\demo.sln. Note that the demo projects require the Ice Visual
Studio Add-In. The add-in is installed automatically when you
use the Ice installer, or you can install the add-in manually by
following the instructions in ..\vsaddin\INSTALL.txt.


Managed Code
------------

By default, Ice for .NET uses unmanaged code for performing protocol
compression and for handling signals in the Ice.Application class.
You can build a managed version of Ice for .NET that lacks the
aforementioned features by editing config/Make.rules.mak.cs and
uncommenting the MANAGED=yes line before you build.


SSL Notes
---------

In order to use SSL with the tests and sample programs, an SSL
certificate must be installed on your system. The configuration files
handle this for you, but you will be presented with a confirmation
dialog the first time you run a test or sample program.

Once you are finished with the tests and sample programs, follow these
steps to remove the certificate:

1) Start Internet Explorer.

2) Select Internet Options from the Tools menu.

3) Select the Content tab and click the "Certificates" button.

4) Select the Trusted Root Certification Authorities tab.

5) Select the entry for "ZeroC Test CA", click the Remove button, and
   confirm that you want to remove this certificate.

Note that under Windows Vista, the IceSSL configuration test is
disabled due to an apparent bug with the .NET framework in which
obsolete SSL session ids are reused and cause server authentication
to fail. This bug manifests itself in those applications that
initialize and destroy multiple IceSSL plug-ins in the same process.
As this is an unusual use case, we don't believe it will affect most
Ice applications.


Running the tests
-----------------

Some of the Ice for .NET tests employ applications that are part of
Ice for C++. If you have not built Ice for C++ from the cpp
subdirectory, then you need to set the ICE_HOME environment variable
to the path where these applications are installed for the tests to
run properly:

  > set ICE_HOME=c:\Ice-@ver@

Python is required to run the test suite:

  http://www.python.org/download

To run the tests, open a command window and change to the top-level
directory. At the command prompt, execute:

  > python allTests.py

You can also run tests individually by changing to the test directory
and running this command:

  > python run.py

If everything worked out, you should see lots of "ok" messages. In
case of a failure, the tests abort with "failed".


Running the demos
-----------------

To run the demos, you need to have the cpp\bin directory in your PATH
and the cs\bin directory in your DEVPATH. See the README file in each
demo directory for a description of the demo.

Note that for demos that use IceSSL, the IceSSL plug-in configuration
does not contain the fully-qualified name (FQN) for the IceSSL
assembly. Instead it just contains the partial name:

  Ice.Plugin.IceSSL=IceSSL:IceSSL.PluginFactory

The IceSSL assembly is found though the use of DEVPATH, which is
enabled in the *.exe.config files. If you want to run an application
using the IceSSL assembly installed in the GAC without the use of the
*.exe.config files, you must add the FQN to the IceSSL plug-in
configuration, as shown below:

  Ice.Plugin.IceSSL=IceSSL, Version=@ver@.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cdd571ade22f2f16:IceSSL.PluginFactory

Note that "cdd571ade22f2f16" is the token corresponding to ZeroC's
public key for signing the assemblies in binary distributions. If you
built Ice from sources, your assemblies were signed using the
development key instead, which you can find in config/IceDevKey.snk.
The token for the development key is "1f998c50fec78381".


Installation
------------

Simply run "nmake /f Makefile.mak install". This will install Ice for
.NET in the directory specified by the "prefix" variable in
config\Make.rules.mak.cs. After installation, make sure that the
<prefix>\bin directory is in your PATH.


GAC Installation
-----------------

You can add the assemblies to the Global Assembly Cache (GAC). To do
this, open Windows Explorer and navigate to the directory
C:\WINDOWS\assembly. Next, drag and drop (or copy and paste) the
assemblies from Ice-@ver@\bin into the right-hand pane to install
them in the cache.

You can also use gacutil from the command line to achieve the same
result:

  > gacutil /i <library.dll>

The gacutil tool is included with your Visual C# installation. For
example, if you have installed Visual C# 9.0 in C:\Program Files, the
path to gacutil is

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\bin\gacutil.exe

Once installed in the cache, the assemblies will always be located
correctly without having to set environment variables or copy them
into the same directory as an executable.

If you want line numbers for stack traces, you must also install the
PDB (.pdb) files in the GAC. Unfortunately, you cannot do this using
Explorer, so you have to do it from the command line. Open a command
shell window and navigate to C:\WINDOWS\assembly\GAC_MSIL\Ice
(assuming C:\WINDOWS is your system root). Doing a directory listing
there, you will find a directory named @dotnetver@__<UUID>, for
example:

  @dotnetver@__1f998c50fec78381

Change to that directory (making sure that you use the correct version
number for this release of Ice). In this directory, you will see the
Ice.dll you installed into the GAC in the preceding step. Now copy the
Ice.pdb file into this directory:

  > copy <path_to_ice.pdb> .


Protocol compression with 64-bit Windows
----------------------------------------

Ice for .NET attempts to dynamically load bzip2.dll to support
protocol compression. On 64-bit Windows, you have to make sure that
the 64-bit version of bzip2.dll is found instead of the 32-bit
version. The bzip2 libraries are installed in <prefix>\bin\x64 and
<prefix>\bin, respectively. For 64-bit Windows, you need to make sure
that <prefix>\bin\x64 appears before <prefix>\bin in your
application's PATH. (The Ice run time prints a warning to the console
if it detects a bzip2.dll format mismatch during start-up.)


.NET Compact Framework
------------------------

The default configuration in config\Make.rules.mak.cs produces Ice
assemblies for use with .NET. If you wish to use Ice with the .NET
Compact Framework, you must re-build the sources.

To build Ice for .NET Compact Framework, open config\Make.rules.mak.cs
and set COMPACT=yes. Run nmake as before:

 > nmake /f Makefile.mak

The .NET Compact Framework assemblies and binaries are generated into
the Assemblies\cf and bin\cf directories, respectively.

To build the demos, you must first install the Ice for Visual Studio
Add-in. You can install the Ice Visual Studio Add-in using the Windows
MSI installer; for manual installation instructions, refer to the file
..\vsaddin\INSTALL.txt.

You must use the Visual Studio solution located in demo\democf.sln to
build the demos.


Silverlight
-----------

The default configuration in config\Make.rules.mak.cs produces Ice
assemblies for use with .NET. If you wish to use Ice with Silverlight,
you must re-build the sources.

The Silverlight assemblies are generated into the Assemblies\sl
directory.

To build Ice for Silverlight, open config\Make.rules.mak.cs and set
SILVERLIGHT=yes. Run nmake as before:

 > nmake /f Makefile.mak

To install Ice for Silverlight simply run

 > nmake /f Makefile.mak install

This will install Ice for Silverlight in the directory specified by
the "prefix" variable in config\Make.rules.mak.cs. The Ice assemblies
will be located in the <prefix>\Assemblies\sl directory.

To build the tests and demos, you must first install the Ice for
Visual Studio Add-in. You can install the Ice Visual Studio Add-in
using the Windows MSI installer; for manual installation instructions,
refer to the file ..\vsaddin\INSTALL.txt.

You must use the Visual Studio solutions located in test\testsl.sln
and demo\demosl.sln to build the tests and demos.

  * Running the tests

    Silverlight has no server-side support, you must use a server
    from another language mapping.

    To run a test, open a command window and change to the test
    directory. At the command prompt, execute:

    > server

    Open test\testsl.sln in Visual Studio and start the corresponding
    test using the "Debug > Start new instance" command. In the test
    application, click "Run".

    If everything worked out, you should see lots of "ok" messages.
    In case of a failure, the tests abort with "failed".

  * Running the demos

    To run the demos, open the solution demo\demosl.sln and follow
    the instructions in the README.txt file of each demo.


Binary compatibility of patch releases
--------------------------------------

Ice patch releases are binary compatible. For example, Ice version
@mmver@.1 is compatible with @mmver@.0: you can run an application built
against Ice @mmver@.0 with Ice @mmver@.1 (or later) without having to
recompile or relink this application.

Please refer to the Ice @ver@ Release Notes for detailed upgrade
instructions.
