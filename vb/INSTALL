Build instructions
------------------

The code has been built and tested with:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Version 9.0.21022.8 RTM and .NET Framework
  Version 3.5.

Unpack the archive. The VB demo sources will be contained in the 
Ice-@ver@\vb subdirectory.

Add the directory containing slice2cs to the list of "Executable
files" directories in Visual Studio:

- In the IDE, choose Tools->Options->Projects->VC++ Directories

- Select "Executable files"

- Add <Ice installation root directory>\bin

To use Visual Basic (or other .NET languages) with Ice, you need
the run-time support provided by the Ice for .NET assembly
(Ice.dll). The Ice for Visual Basic build environment expects
Ice.dll to be installed in $(solutiondir)\..\cs\bin.  Alternatively,
you can install Ice.dll in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC). Refer to the
INSTALL.VISUAL_C# file in the cs subdirectory for instructions on
installing the asemblies in the GAC.

To compile your Slice definitions, you need to use slice2cs to generate
C# source code and use a C# compiler to compile the generated code into
a DLL. Then reference that DLL from your Visual Basic project.

See the Ice Manual and the makefiles and Visual Studio projects included
with the demos for more information.


Building demos with Visual Basic
--------------------------------

Open demo\demo.sln in Visual Basic and build the solution. (Both release
and debug builds are supported.)
