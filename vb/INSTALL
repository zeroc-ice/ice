Build instructions
------------------

The code has been built and tested with Visual Basic Version 7.1.3088
and .NET Framework 1.1 Version 1.1.4322.

Unpack the archive. The sources will be contained in the 'icevb'
subdirectory.

You can either build the slice2vb compiler from the Ice for C++ source
distribution, or you can download the Ice binary package for Windows,
which contains a compiled version of slice2vb. Make sure that the
directory containing slice2vb is in your PATH. Note that icecpp.exe
must be in your path as well, as must be the Ice for C++ run-time
libraries iceutil and slice.

Open icevb/All.sln in Visual Basic# and build the "All" solution (both
debug and release builds are supported). Note that Ice for Visual
Basic is just a language mapping on top of Ice for C# -- the actual
run-time support is provided by icecs.dll. The build environment
expects icecs.dll to be installed in $(solutiondir)/icecs/bin.
Alternatively, you can install icecs.dll in the GAC. (See Ice for C#
for details of how to do this.)

Please let us know about any bugs, comments, or feedback in the Ice
forum at http://www.zeroc.com/vbulletin/.
