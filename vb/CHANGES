Changes since version 3.0.0
---------------------------

- Added IceBox, IceGrid and IceStorm demos.

Changes since version 2.1.2
---------------------------

- Changed the mapping for Slice structures: if a Slice
  structure (recursively) contains a member that is of
  reference type, the Slice structure automatically maps
  to a VB class.

  A Slice structure now maps to a VB structure only if
  the Slice structure (recursively) consists only of
  value type (and if the "clr:class" metadata directive
  does not apply to the structure).

- The run time was obscuring the true origin (source file and
  line number) of some exceptions when rethrowing them. It
  now correctly shows the source of such exceptions
  in the stack trace.

- Added a new object adapter property, <adapter>.ReplicaGroupId, which
  allows adapters to be replicated. See the IceGrid chapter in the
  manual for more information.

- Added the proxy method ice_connectionId, which allows an application
  to control connection reuse.

- Added the new methods Ice.Util.initializeWithLogger() and
  Ice.Util.initializeWithPropertiesAndLogger(), which ensure that a
  custom logger is used to record any errors during communicator
  initialization.

- Ice will now listen on all local interfaces if no -h parameter 
  is present in the endpoint configuration and no default host has
  been set. It will also listen to all interfaces if the -h parameter
  is set to 0.0.0.0. In such configurations the endpoints published
  in proxies will not contain the loopback interface (127.0.0.1) 
  unless it is the only local interface present.

- The Equals method for Slice structures that are mapped
  to classes now returns false if the two structures being
  compared are not of the same type.

  Previously, a comparison such as

      derived.Equals(base)

  returned true if the base of part of derived was
  the same as base; with the new slice2vb compiler, this
  comparison returns false.

- The Slice mapping for sequences has been improved. The
  generated sequence class now contains the following additional
  properties and methods:

  - Capacity
  - TrimToSize
  - Sort
  - Reverse
  - BinarySearch
  - InsertRange
  - RemoveRange
  - GetRange
  - SetRange
  - LastIndexOf
  - Repeat

  These have the same semantics as the corresponding methods
  on System.Collections.ArrayList, with one exception: GetRange
  returns a true copy of the requested range instead of returning
  a view of a sub-section of the collection.

- The Ice run-time libraries are now marked as CLS-compliant
  assemblies. In addition, the generated code is now also
  CLS-compliant.

  This involves one change to the VB language mapping:

  The skeleton class used be called _<interface-name>Disp but
  is now called <interface-name>Disp_.

  For example, if you previously had:

      Public Class MyIntfI
          Inherits _MyIntfDisp
	  ' ...
      End Class

  you now have to write:

      Public Class MyIntfI
          Inherits MyIntfDisp_
	  ' ...
      End Class

  Similarly, for the Tie mapping, the location of the underscore
  has changed:

      _MyIntfTie -> MyIntfTie_

- Added support for the thread-per-connection concurrency model.

- Changed the way servant locators work if a server has a servant
  locator registered for a specific category, in addition to a default
  servant locator. Previously, if the locator for the specific category
  failed to locate the servant, the run time would then call the default
  locator. With the new behavior, if the locator for the specific category
  does not return a servant, the default locator is not called.

- slice2vb now supports a new metadata directive: ["vb:attribute"].
  This directive allows you to inject VB attribute definitions into the
  generated code. See the VB mapping chapter in the Ice manual for
  more information.

- The "vb:" metadata prefix has been replaced by the "clr:" prefix,
  so you now need to use "clr:collection" and "clr:class".
  The "vb:" prefix is still recognized and acted upon; slice2vb
  emits a warning for the old prefix. Two releases from now, the
  warning will become a hard error and "vb:" will no longer work.

- Fixed a bug in the slice2vb code generator: for sequences of
  Slice structs that used the class mapping, the generated code
  caused a run-time error.

- Fixed a bug in the slice2vb code generator: if an operation
  had a parameter named ix or spx, incorrect code was generated
  in some cases.

- Added ice_communicator() to proxies. This function returns
  the communicator that was used to create the proxy.

- Added ice_toString() to proxies. This function returns
  the stringified proxy. This function can be more convenient
  to use than communicator.stringToProxy() because you do
  not need the communicator to stringify a proxy that way.

- Ice.ObjectImpl is now an abstract class that cannot be instantiated.
  This change should be transparent to application code.

- Added new features to the Visual Basic mapping:

  - Structures, classes, and exceptions now have one-shot
    constructors. For example, for a class

      class Example {
          int i;
	  string s;
      };

    the following constructors are generated:

      Public Class Example Inherits Ice.ObjectImpl
	  Public Sub New() ...
	  Public Sub New(ByVal i as Integer, ByVal s As String) ...

    This allows you to construct a structure, class, or exception and
    supply values for the data members in a single statement, instead
    of having to assign to the members of a default-constructed
    instance.

    For derived exceptions and classes, the constructor expects values
    for all data members, including those of base exceptions or
    classes, in base-to-derived order of declaration.

Changes since version 2.1.1
---------------------------

- Fixed a bug in the code generator: incorrect code was generated
  if an operation used an exception from an unrelated module in
  its exception specification.

Changes since version 2.1.0
---------------------------

- Added sequences of fixed-length elements to throughput demo.

- Added -E option to the various Slice compilers to print preprocessor
  output on stdout.

- Fixed a bug in the option parsing for Ice tools such as slice2cpp,
  slice2java, slice2cs, etc. The option parser used to incorrectly
  complain about repeated options when in fact no option was
  repeated. Also changed the parser to permit options to follow an
  argument, so

      slice2cpp -I. x.ice

  and

      slice2cpp x.ice -I.

  are now equivalent.

Changes since version 2.0.0
---------------------------

- Fixed bug in the code generators for C# and VB: for sequences
  of structs and sequences of Object*, incorrect code was generated
  if a ["cs:collection"] or ["vb:collection"] metadata directive
  was used.

- Added setDefaultContext() and getDefaultContext() to the
  Ice::Communicator interface. This allows a default context to be
  established on a communicator-wide basis. See section 29.8.3 in the
  doc.

  Added ice_defaultContext to Ice::ObjectProxy. This creates a new
  proxy that uses the default context established on the communicator.

- Overloaded the checkedCast member function of the generated PrxHelper
  classes to allow a trailing argument of type Ice::Context. This makes
  it possible to do stateful things that require a context in a
  servant locator's activate() method.

- Fixed a bug in slice2vb: incorrect code was generated if an interface
  was derived from a base interface in a different module if the base
  interface contained a AMD operation.
