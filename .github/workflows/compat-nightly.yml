# Builds tests from a stable tag and distribution libraries from the branch HEAD, then swaps the HEAD libraries into
# the stable test tree and runs the tests. If the tests pass, the HEAD libraries are binary-compatible with that stable
# release.

# Each stable branch (3.7, 3.8) maintains its own copy of this workflow with branch-specific configuration below.
