## Prerequisites

1. Node.js 22 or later.
2. The Slice-to-JavaScript compiler (`slice2js`).
3. The Ice for C++ test suite, for running JavaScript client tests against the C++ servers.
4. Python 3.12 is required for running the tests. The Glacier2 test also requires the `passlib` Python package.
5. Ice for Python is required for running the JavaScript tests in a web browser.

## Building Ice for JavaScript

Before building Ice for JavaScript, you must first build the Ice for C++ source distribution.
Refer to the [build instructions](../cpp/BUILDING.md) in the `cpp` subdirectory for details.

Once Ice for C++ is built, open a command prompt and navigate to the `js` subdirectory.
To build Ice for JavaScript, run the following commands:

```shell
npm install
npm run build
```

> On Windows, if youâ€™re not using the default C++ build configuration (i.e., x64/Release), you need to ensure that the
> JavaScript build process can locate the correct `slice2js` compiler. To do this, set the `CPP_PLATFORM` and
> `CPP_CONFIGURATION` environment variables, or pass the `--cppPlatform` and `--cppConfiguration` arguments to the
> `npm run build` command to match your C++ platform and configuration settings.

For example, when using a C++ **Debug** build for **Win32**, you can run:

```shell
set CPP_CONFIGURATION=Debug
set CPP_PLATFORM=Win32
npm run build
```

or

```shell
npm run build -- --cppPlatform=Win32 --cppConfiguration=Debug
```

## Running the Tests

To run the JavaScript tests with Node.js, open a command prompt and change to the `js` subdirectory. At the command
prompt, execute:

```shell
python allTests.py --all
```

To run the JavaScript tests in a web browser, use the `--browser Manual` and follow the instructions
to load the provided URL in the browser.

```shell
python allTests.py --all --browser Manual
```

## Creating the NPM package

To create the `@zeroc/ice` NPM package, open a command prompt and change to the `js` subdirectory. Then run the
following command:

```shell
npm pack
```

### Slice Compilers

By default, the NPM package `@zeroc/ice` includes only the `slice2js` compiler created by the local C++ build.

If you set the environment variable `SLICE2JS_STAGING_PATH`, `@zeroc/ice` includes the `slice2js` compiler for all
supported platforms. The expected layout of the staging directory is `<os-name>-<os-arch>/<compiler-executable>`,
with the following subdirectories:

- `linux-x64`: Linux x86_64
- `linux-arm64`: Linux ARM64
- `macos-arm64`: macOS Apple silicon
- `windows-x64`: Windows x64

Make sure that all these compilers are available when you set `SLICE2JS_STAGING_PATH`.

## Generating the API Reference

The API reference can be generated by running the following command:

```shell
npm run build-doc
```

This command generates the API reference into the `docs` directory. Start a local web server to view this API reference:

```shell
npx http-server docs
```
