This directory contains a PHP/HTML implementation of the Ice hello
client. The procedure for installing this script depends on your Web
server environment. For example, if you're using PHP as a Web server
module, then you'll need to install this script in your document root
directory.

Alternatively, if you're using CGI, then you will need to make this
script executable, add a line at the top of the script to indicate the
path to the PHP CGI binary, and copy the script to your cgi-bin
directory. On Unix platforms, the line at the top of the file should
look something like the one below, where /opt/php5 is the PHP5
installation directory:

#! /opt/php5/bin/php

Next, the PHP configuration must be modified to load the Slice
definitions required by this example. In php.ini, set this directive:

ice.slice=/opt/icephp/demo/Ice/hello/Hello.ice

For a Linux RPM installation, this directive can be added to
/etc/php.d/ice.ini.

Finally, start the hello server on the Web server host and try out the
script.

Note that support for secure invocations via SSL are disabled by
default. If you have configured SSL for the Ice extension, edit
hello.php and set the have_ssl variable to true.
