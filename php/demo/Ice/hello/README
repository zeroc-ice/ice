This directory contains a PHP/HTML implementation of the Ice hello
client. The procedure for installing this script depends on your Web
server environment. For example, if you're using PHP as a Web server
module, then you'll need to install this script in your document root
directory.

Alternatively, if you're using CGI, then you will need to make this
script executable, add a line at the top of the script to indicate the
path to the PHP CGI binary, and copy the script to your cgi-bin
directory. On Linux or Solaris, the line at the top of the file should
look something like this, where /opt/php5 is the PHP5 installation
directory:

#! /opt/php5/bin/php

Note that if you haven't installed the IceSSL shared library in order
to use it from the Ice extension, you will also need to modify the
script to remove the SSL endpoint from the stringified proxy.

Next, the PHP configuration must be modified to load the Slice
definitions required by this example. In php.ini, set this directive:

ice.slice=/opt/icephp/demo/Ice/hello/Hello.ice

Finally, start the hello server on the Web server host and try out the
script.
