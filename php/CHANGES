Changes since version 3.2.x (HEAD ONLY)
---------------------------

- Added support for an optional context argument to ice_checkedCast
  and ice_uncheckedCast.

- Added the following proxy methods:

  ice_getRouter/ice_router
  ice_getLocator/ice_locator

- Added the translator option "-w" to suppress warnings during Slice
  translation.

Changes since version 3.2.0
---------------------------

- Added Communicator::setProperty.

- All local methods on a proxy that return the "same" proxy with
  a different attribute (such as ice_oneway and ice_secure) now return
  a proxy of the same class as the original. As a result, once you
  have downcast a proxy, it will rarely be necessary to downcast it
  again. For example, you can rewrite the following statements

  $base = $ICE->stringToProxy(...);
  $twoway = $base->ice_checkedCast("::Demo::Hello");
  $oneway = $twoway->ice_oneway()->ice_uncheckedCast("::Demo::Hello");

  as simply

  $base = $ICE->stringToProxy(...);
  $twoway = $base->ice_checkedCast("::Demo::Hello");
  $oneway = $twoway->ice_oneway();

  The local methods ice_facet and ice_identity still return a proxy of
  the base class Ice_ObjectPrx, since a change to the proxy's facet
  or identity typically refers to an object with a different Slice
  type and therefore requires a new downcast.

  This change does not affect the behavior of existing code. However,
  code that depends on these new semantics will not run correctly
  using prior versions of Ice.

Changes since version 3.1.1
---------------------------

- This release is compatible with PHP 5.1.6, 5.2.0, and 5.2.1.

- Added the following proxy methods:

  ice_isPreferSecure
  ice_preferSecure
  ice_isThreadPerConnection
  ice_threadPerConnection
  ice_getCachedConnection

- Added Communicator::propertyToProxy() which creates a proxy from
  a set of properties. This function allows you to set various local
  proxy settings, such as the locator cache timeout, which cannot be
  set using stringToProxy().

- The supported platforms for IcePHP are now Linux and Windows XP.
  The process for building IcePHP on Linux has also changed; see the
  INSTALL file for details.

- Added UnexpectedObjectException. This exception is raised if you
  use Slice classes and client and server are compiled with mismatched
  Slice definitions. Alternatively, this exception is raised if you
  use dynamic invocation and pass a class of the wrong type as an
  operation parameter.

Changes since version 3.1.0
---------------------------

- No changes.

Changes since version 3.0.1
---------------------------

- Removed removeObjectFactory() from the communicator interface.

- PHP 5.1.4 is the required version for this release.

- Added identityToString and stringToIdentity to the Communicator
  interface.

- Removed setDefaultContext operation on Communicator.

- Eliminated the source of deprecation warnings when E_STRICT is
  enabled.

- Added proxy method ice_getSecure.

- Deprecated the following proxy methods:

  ice_communicator
  ice_connection
  ice_newIdentity
  ice_newFacet
  ice_newContext
  ice_newAdapterId
  ice_newEndpoints

  These methods will be removed in the next major release. You should
  use the new methods shown below:

  ice_getCommunicator
  ice_getConnection
  ice_identity
  ice_facet
  ice_context
  ice_adapterId
  ice_endpoints

- Added the property Ice.Default.LocatorCacheTimeout and the proxy
  method ice_locatorCacheTimeout(). If a cached endpoint is older
  than the configured cache timeout, the Ice runtime won't use
  the cached endpoint. Instead, the Ice runtime will query the
  Ice locator service to retrieve up-to-date endpoints and then update
  the locator cache. Please see the Ice manual for more information.

- Added the proxy method ice_endpointSelection, which allows an
  application to control how endpoints are selected at connection
  establishment. Two endpoint selection types are currently supported:
  Random and Ordered.

- Added the proxy method ice_cacheConnection. This method allows you
  to enable or disable the caching of the connection by the proxy. By
  default, the proxy will cache the connection to avoid looking it up
  for each request. Disabling the connection caching is useful to do
  per-request load balancing: the proxy will select a connection for
  each request and the request will eventually be sent to different 
  servers.

- Added support for the Ice::Connection interface.

Changes since version 3.0.0
---------------------------

- Fixed a bug in the Slice parser that caused problems if an
  included file contained white space in the file name.

- Added source compatibility with PHP 5.1.2. A configure script for
  PHP 5.1.2 is provided as configure-5.1.2.gz.

Changes since version 2.1.2
---------------------------

- Removed ice_default() method from proxies.

- Added the proxy method ice_connectionId, which allows an application
  to control connection reuse.

- Ice_loadProfile now raises Ice_ProfileNotFoundException if a
  given profile is not found and Ice_ProfileAlreadyLoadedException
  if a profile has already been loaded.

- Added proxy methods to retrieve the proxy adapter id and endpoints
  (ice_getAdapterId() and ice_getEndpoints()) and to create a new
  proxy with a new adapter id or new endpoints (ice_newAdapterId() and
  ice_newEndpoints()).

- Added ice_communicator() and ice_toString() to proxies. The return
  value of ice_communicator() is always the value of $ICE.

- Ice.ObjectImpl is now an abstract class that cannot be instantiated.
  This change should be transparent to application code.

Changes since version 2.1.0
---------------------------

- Added -E option to the various Slice compilers to print preprocessor
  output on stdout.

- A crash occurred if the global variable $ICE was used before a
  profile was loaded. This now causes an error message.

- Attempting to print a proxy value resulted in a fatal error.
  This has been fixed so that printing a proxy displays it in
  stringified form.

Changes since version 2.0.0
---------------------------

- Added setDefaultContext() and getDefaultContext() to the
  Ice::Communicator interface. This allows a default context to be
  established on a communicator-wide basis. See section 29.8.3 in
  the doc.

  Added ice_defaultContext to Ice::ObjectProxy. This creates a new
  proxy that uses the default context established on the communicator.

Changes since version 1.1.2
---------------------------

- Compatibility with Ice 2.0.0.

- Added the communicator method getProperty(name[, default]).

- The configuration directives in an INI file are now named
  "ice.config", "ice.slice", and "ice.options", for consistency
  with the global directives. The previous directive names are
  still supported.

- Fixed a bug that prevented Apache 1.x from starting.

- The documentation has always stated that same-named constructs
  cannot be directly nested inside each other. (For example, a
  module `M' cannot contain a constant named `M'.) The Slice parser
  compiler did not enforce this correctly up to now for modules
  containing constructs with the same name as the enclosing module.
  This has been fixed and now results in a diagnostic.

- The Slice parser now deprecates Slice definitions at global scope:
  only modules can be defined at global scope. Everything else
  (constants, classes, interfaces, etc.) must be defined inside a
  module.

  For the time being, the compiler issues a warning for each global
  definition but continues to compile the code. Global non-module
  definitions will elicit a hard error two releases from now.

Changes since version 1.1.1
---------------------------

- Fixed a compilation error for Visual C++.

Changes since version 1.1.0
---------------------------

- Compatibility with PHP 5.0.0 (final).

Changes since version 1.0.3
---------------------------

- Changed facet interface to be compatible with Ice 1.4.0.

- Added the proxy methods ice_newContext and ice_getContext.

- Fixed a bug that could cause a marshaling exception for uninitialized
  string data members.

- Fixed a marshaling bug that caused an assertion failure in the value
  demo.

Changes since version 1.0.2
---------------------------

- Fixed a link error when compiling with Visual C++ 6.0.

Changes since version 1.0.1
---------------------------

- Updated for compatibility with Ice 1.3.0 and PHP5 beta4. The patch
  in the file patch.txt must be applied to PHP5b4 prior to building
  it on Unix platforms.

- Added the member functions ice_preMarshal and ice_postUnmarshal to
  Ice_Object. The default implementations do nothing, but subclasses
  may override them to take special action before marshaling and after
  unmarshaling, respectively.

- Added __toString functions to certain Ice exceptions.

- Added support for building on HP-UX with aCC.

- Added configure script to simplify building on Linux/Solaris/HP-UX.

Changes since version 1.0.0
---------------------------

- Minor fixes for compatibility with PHP 5.0.0b2.

- Fixes for Ice 1.2.0 API changes. The ice_flush operation has been
  removed from proxies, and the operation flushBatchRequests has been
  added to the communicator.

- The base Ice exception class (Ice_Exception) now derives from the PHP
  base exception class (Exception). Also, the mapping for exceptions now
  supports an optional string argument to constructors. This argument
  represents the exception "message" and is passed to the base Exception
  constructor unmodified.
