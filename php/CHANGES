Changes since version 2.1.0
---------------------------

- Fixed a bug in the option parsing for Ice tools such as
  slice2cpp, slice2java, slice2cs, etc. The option parser
  used to incorrectly complain about repeated options when
  in fact no option was repeated. Also changed the parser
  to permit options to follow an argument, so

      slice2cpp -I. x.ice

  and

      slice2cpp x.ice -I.

  are now equivalent.

Changes since version 2.0.0
---------------------------

- Added setDefaultContext() and getDefaultContext() to the
  Ice::Communicator interface. This allows a default context to be
  established on a communicator-wide basis. See section 29.8.3 in
  the doc.

  Added ice_defaultContext to Ice::ObjectProxy. This creates a new
  proxy that uses the default context established on the communicator.

Changes since version 1.1.2
---------------------------

- Compatibility with Ice 2.0.0.

- Added the communicator method getProperty(name[, default]).

- The configuration directives in an INI file are now named
  "ice.config", "ice.slice", and "ice.options", for consistency
  with the global directives. The previous directive names are
  still supported.

- Fixed a bug that prevented Apache 1.x from starting.

- The documentation has always stated that same-named constructs
  cannot be directly nested inside each other. (For example, a
  module `M' cannot contain a constant named `M'.) The Slice parser
  compiler did not enforce this correctly up to now for modules
  containing constructs with the same name as the enclosing module.
  This has been fixed and now results in a diagnostic.

- The Slice parser now deprecates Slice definitions at global scope:
  only modules can be defined at global scope. Everything else
  (constants, classes, interfaces, etc.) must be defined inside a
  module.

  For the time being, the compiler issues a warning for each global
  definition but continues to compile the code. Global non-module
  definitions will elicit a hard error two releases from now.

Changes since version 1.1.1
---------------------------

- Fixed a compilation error for Visual C++.

Changes since version 1.1.0
---------------------------

- Compatibility with PHP 5.0.0 (final).

Changes since version 1.0.3
---------------------------

- Changed facet interface to be compatible with Ice 1.4.0.

- Added the proxy methods ice_newContext and ice_getContext.

- Fixed a bug that could cause a marshaling exception for uninitialized
  string data members.

- Fixed a marshaling bug that caused an assertion failure in the value
  demo.

Changes since version 1.0.2
---------------------------

- Fixed a link error when compiling with Visual C++ 6.0.

Changes since version 1.0.1
---------------------------

- Updated for compatibility with Ice 1.3.0 and PHP5 beta4. The patch
  in the file patch.txt must be applied to PHP5b4 prior to building
  it on Unix platforms.

- Added the member functions ice_preMarshal and ice_postUnmarshal to
  Ice_Object. The default implementations do nothing, but subclasses
  may override them to take special action before marshaling and after
  unmarshaling, respectively.

- Added __toString functions to certain Ice exceptions.

- Added support for building on HP-UX with aCC.

- Added configure script to simplify building on Linux/Solaris/HP-UX.

Changes since version 1.0.0
---------------------------

- Minor fixes for compatibility with PHP 5.0.0b2.

- Fixes for Ice 1.2.0 API changes. The ice_flush operation has been
  removed from proxies, and the operation flushBatchRequests has been
  added to the communicator.

- The base Ice exception class (Ice_Exception) now derives from the PHP
  base exception class (Exception). Also, the mapping for exceptions now
  supports an optional string argument to constructors. This argument
  represents the exception "message" and is passed to the base Exception
  constructor unmodified.
