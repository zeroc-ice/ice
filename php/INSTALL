Requirements
======================================================================

- A supported version of PHP:

  * 5.1.2 (SLES 10)
  * 5.1.6 (RHEL)
  * 5.2.5 (source builds)

  You can download PHP from

    http://www.php.net/downloads.php

- Ice for C++ @ver@ development kit


======================================================================
Building PHP with the Ice extension (Linux)
======================================================================

This source distribution only supports building Ice for PHP as a dynamic
PHP extension; the product of the build is a shared library that you
must configure PHP to load.

Follow the steps below to build Ice for PHP:

1. Change to Ice for PHP source subdirectory.

   > cd Ice-@ver@/php

2. Edit config/Make.rules and review the build settings. For example,
   you may want to enable OPTIMIZE. If your PHP installation resides
   in a non-standard location, modify the PHP_HOME setting to contain
   the installation directory.

3. If you have not built Ice for C++ from the cpp subdirectory, then
   set the ICE_HOME environment variable to the directory containing 
   your Ice installation. For example, if Ice is installed in
   /opt/Ice-@ver@, set ICE_HOME as follows:

   $ export ICE_HOME=/opt/Ice-@ver@

   If you installed Ice using RPMs, set ICE_HOME as shown below:

   $ export ICE_HOME=/usr

3. Run make.


======================================================================
Building PHP with the Ice extension (Windows)
======================================================================

Compiling PHP from source code on Windows is a tedious process,
therefore we recommend that you download the binary distribution
for PHP and use it along with the precompiled dynamic Ice extension
included in the Ice installer for Visual C++ 6.0.

If you prefer to build the Ice extension yourself, you must first
understand the C run time dependency issues. Specifically, the Ice
extension must use the same C run time as PHP5. Since the binary
distribution of PHP5 available from php.net depends on the Visual C++
6.0 run time DLL (MSVCRT), you must also build the Ice extension using
Visual C++ 6.0 if you want to use Ice with this PHP distribution. This
is why the precompiled Ice extension is included in the Ice installer
for Visual C++ 6.0, as attempting to use an Ice extension that was
built with a newer compiler together with the binary PHP distribution
results in undefined behavior.

To use a later version of Visual C++, you must obtain (or build) PHP5
with the desired compiler, and use the same compiler to build the Ice
extension. Refer to the PHP documentation for instructions on building
PHP5 from source.

Follow these instructions to build the Ice extension:

1) Download the PHP5 binary archive or Windows installer and install
   the distribution.

2) Download and extract the PHP5 sources (Ice for PHP requires the PHP
   header files).

3) Open a command window.

4) If you have not built Ice for C++ from the cpp subdirectory then you 
   need to set the ICE_HOME environment variable to the location of your
   Ice for C++ installation. For example:

   > set ICE_HOME=C:\Ice-@ver@-VC60

5) Change to the Ice for PHP source directory.

  > cd Ice-@ver@\php

6) Open config\Make.rules.mak, review the comments, and make any
   necessary changes. In particular, you may need to change the values
   of PHP_HOME and PHP_BIN_HOME to refer to your PHP source and binary
   installations, respectively. If you compiled PHP from source, you
   should also review the setting of PHP_LIBDIR.

7) Start NMAKE:

   nmake /f Makefile.mak

8) Upon successful completion, the Ice for PHP extension is created as
   bin\php_ice.dll (Release) or bin\php_iced.dll (Debug).


======================================================================
Installing the Extension (Linux)
======================================================================

To install the Ice extension, you must move the extension's shared
library into PHP's extension directory. This directory is determined
by the PHP configuration directive "extension_dir". You can determine
the default value for this directive by running the command-line
version of PHP with the -i option:

  php -i

Review the output for a line like this:

  extension_dir => /usr/lib/php/modules => /usr/lib/php/modules

Once you've copied the extension to PHP's extension directory, you
will need to enable the extension in your PHP configuration. Your
PHP installation likely supports the /etc/php.d configuration
directory, which you can verify by examining the output of "php -i"
and looking for the presence of --with-config-file-scan-dir in the
"Configure Command" entry. If present, you can create a file in
/etc/php.d that contains the directive to load the Ice extension.
For example, create the file /etc/php.d/ice.ini containing the
following line:

  extension = IcePHP.so

If PHP does not support the /etc/php.d directory, determine the path
name of PHP's configuration file as reported by the "php -i" command:

  Configuration File (php.ini) Path => /etc/php.ini

Open the configuration file and append the following line:

  extension = IcePHP.so

You can verify that PHP is loading the Ice extension by running the
command shown below:

  php -m

Look for "ice" among the installed modules. Note that your library
search path (LD_LIBRARY_PATH) must include the directory containing
the Ice shared libraries. See the section "Dependencies" below for
more information.


======================================================================
Installing the Extension (Windows)
======================================================================

To install the Ice extension, you must move the extension's shared
library into PHP's extension directory. This directory is determined
by the PHP configuration directive "extension_dir". You can determine
the default value for this directive by running the command-line
version of PHP with the -i option:

  php -i

Review the output for a line like this:

  extension_dir => C:\php5 => C:\php5

The directive may also be set to a relative path, such as:

  extension_dir => ./ => ./

In the case of a relative path, the value is relative to the current
working directory of the process. As a result, the working directory
when running the command-line version of PHP will likely differ from
the working directory when PHP is running as a Web server module.
Using a typical installation of Apache as an example, the working
directory is Apache's installation directory, therefore the extension
must be copied to

  \Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2

Once you've copied the extension to the appropriate directory, you
will need to enable the extension in your PHP configuration. First you
must discover the location of PHP's configuration file (php.ini),
which is also displayed by the -i option. Look for the following
line:

  Loaded Configuration File => C:\Program Files\PHP\php.ini

If you used the Windows installer for PHP, your Web server's
configuration may have already been modified to load PHP. You can also
review your Web server's settings to discover the location of php.ini.
For example, the Windows installer modifies Apache's configuration to
add the following directives:

  PHPIniDir "C:/Program Files/PHP/"
  LoadModule php5_module "C:/Program Files/PHP/php5apache2_2.dll"

The PHPIniDir directive specifies the directory containing the php.ini
file.

Open php.ini and append this directive:

  extension = php_ice.dll


======================================================================
Dependencies
======================================================================

PHP will need to be able to locate the Ice run-time libraries "Ice",
"Slice", "IceUtil" and "bzip2" (Windows) or "libbz2" (Unix). On
Windows, the STLport library is also necessary. In general, these
libraries must reside in a directory of the user's PATH.

For Web servers, the libraries may need to reside in a system
directory. For example, on Linux you can add the directory containing
the Ice run-time libraries to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig. On
Windows, you can copy the DLLs to the C:\WINDOWS\system32 directory,
or to the Apache installation directory.

You can verify that the Ice extension is installed properly by
examining the output of the "php -m" command, or by calling the
phpInfo() function from a script. For example, you can create a file
in the Web server's document directory containing the following PHP
script:

  <?php
  phpInfo();
  ?>

Then start a browser window and open the URL corresponding to this
script. If the Ice extension is successfully installed, you will see
an "ice" section among the configuration information.

Note that if you want to use IceSSL from the Ice extension, then PHP
will also need access to the shared libraries for IceSSL and OpenSSL.


======================================================================
Permissions
======================================================================

The Web server normally runs in a special user account that may not
necessarily have access to the Ice extension, its dependent libraries,
and other resources such as Ice configuration files, Slice files, and
PHP scripts. It is very important that you review the permissions of
these files and verify that the Web server has sufficient access.

For example, on Windows the Apache server typically runs as a service
in the "Local System" account. You will need to modify the access
rights of the aforementioned files to grant access to this account.
In a command window, you can use the "cacls" utility to establish the
appropriate access rights. Assuming that you have copied the Ice
extension and dependent DLLs to Apache's installation directory, you
can modify the access rights as shown below:

  cd \Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2
  cacls php_ice.dll /G SYSTEM:F Administrators:F
  cacls bzip2.dll /G SYSTEM:F Administrators:F
  ...

On Linux, Apache typically runs in the "apache" account, so you will
either need to change the owner or group of the libraries and other
resources, or modify their permissions to make them sufficiently
accessible.


======================================================================
Apache Notes (Windows)
======================================================================

Apache's executable has a relatively small default stack size. You can
determine its current stack size with the following commands:

  cd \Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2\bin
  dumpbin /all httpd.exe | find "stack"

The relevant output line is shown below:

  40000 size of stack reserve

The default size is 0x40000 bytes, which is too small to effectively
use the Ice extension. Attempting to load even a trivial Slice file
causes Apache to fail during startup with a stack overflow error.

To increase the stack size, use the editbin utility. Note that the
new stack size is given in decimal:

  editbin /stack:1048576 httpd.exe

Now execute dumpbin again to verify that the change was made:

  dumpbin /all httpd.exe | find "stack"

The new output line is shown below:

  100000 size of stack reserve



======================================================================
SELinux Notes
======================================================================

SELinux augments the traditional Unix permissions with a number of
new features. In particular, SELinux can prevent the httpd daemon from
opening network connections and reading files without the proper
SELinux types.

If you suspect that your Ice for PHP application does not work due to
SELinux restrictions, we recommend that you first try it with SELinux
disabled. As root, run:

# setenforce 0

to disable SELinux until the next reboot of your computer.

If you want to run httpd with Ice for PHP and SELinux enabled, you must
do the following:

- Allow httpd to open network connections:

  # setsebool httpd_can_network_connect=1 

  (add the -P option to make this setting persistent across reboots)

- Make sure any .ice file used by your PHP scripts can be read by 
  httpd. The enclosing directory also needs to be accessible. For
  example:

  # chcon -R -t httpd_sys_content_t /opt/MyApp/slice 

For more information on SELinux in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, refer
to the link below:

  http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/RHEL-4-Manual/selinux-guide/


======================================================================
Running the Tests
======================================================================

The test subdirectory contains PHP implementations of the core Ice
test suite. In order to run these tests, you must have Python 2.2
or later, and the Ice for C++ tests must be built in the directory
specified by the ICE_HOME environment variable.

The test scripts require that the CLI version of the PHP interpreter
be available in your PATH.

To run all of the tests, do the following:

  > python allTests.py

You can also run tests individually by changing to the test directory
and running this command:

  > python run.py

If everything worked out, you should see lots of "ok" messages. In
case of a failure, the tests abort with "failed".
