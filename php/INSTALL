Requirements
=========================================================================

- PHP 5.1.4 (http://www.php.net/downloads.php)
- Ice for C++ @ver@ Development Kit


=========================================================================
Building PHP with the Ice extension (Linux/Solaris/HP-UX/MacOS X/AIX)
=========================================================================

PHP's build system can create several versions of the PHP interpreter.
There are the command-line interface (CLI) and Common Gateway
Interface (CGI) interpreters, both of which are standalone
executables. In addition, the build system can package the interpreter
as a shared library for use as a Web server module.

To further complicate matters, PHP extensions (such as the Ice
extension) can be either static or dynamic. A static extension is
compiled into the interpreter, whereas a dynamic extension is created
as a standalone shared library that is installed in PHP via
configuration directives.

The Ice extension for PHP supports both static and dynamic
configurations. The only supported way to compile the Ice extension is
as part of the larger PHP build process. Unfortunately, PHP's build
system does not completely accommodate extensions written in C++,
therefore some manual intervention is required on certain platforms.

If you are compiling PHP as a Web server module, please be aware that
you will likely also need to install the Web server's development kit.
For example, the apxs utility is required to build PHP for Apache, and
this utility is not typically included in an Apache run time
installation. You must either build Apache from source, or install an
additional package that contains Apache's development tools.


Adding the Ice extension
------------------------

After downloading and extracting the PHP5 source code, you must
incorporate the Ice extension sources into the PHP5 source tree.
There are two ways to do this:

1) Copy the extension source directory.

   $ cd <icephpdir>
   $ cp -r src/ice <phpdir>/ext

2) Create a symbolic link to the extension:

   $ cd <phpdir>/ext
   $ ln -s <icephpdir>/src/ice ice


Updating configure
------------------

In order to make the PHP build system aware of the Ice extension, the
configure script must be updated. The IcePHP distribution includes
a replacement script that you can install:

$ cd <phpdir>
$ cp <icephpdir>/configure.gz .
$ gunzip configure.gz

Alternatively, you can regenerate the configure script yourself if you
have the necessary utilities installed on your system:

$ cd <phpdir>
$ rm -rf configure autom4te.cache
$ ./buildconf --force


Running configure
-----------------

Set the CC and CXX environment variables to the names of your C and
C++ compilers, respectively.

You are now ready to configure PHP. To include support for a static
Ice extension, use the --with-ice option to specify the location of
the Ice installation:

$ ./configure --with-ice=$ICE_HOME ...

If you want to build a dynamic Ice extension, use this version of the
--with-ice option:

$ ./configure --with-ice=shared,$ICE_HOME ...

Note that additional configuration options may be generally necessary.
Please refer to the PHP documentation for more information.


Source patches
--------------

The following changes are necessary on AIX:

- Edit the file <phpdir>/Zend/zend_language_parser.c and remove line
  2582, indicated below:

  int
  yyparse ()
      ;      /* REMOVE THIS LINE */

- Edit the file <phpdir>/Zend/zend_ini_parser.c and remove line 1078,
  indicated below:

  int
  yyparse ()
      ;      /* REMOVE THIS LINE */


Platform-specific Issues
------------------------

Please refer to the relevant section for your platform below before
proceeding any further.


Build PHP
---------

Finally, run make:

$ make

Note that if the Ice extension's config.m4 file is changed, then you
must repeat the steps above to regenerate the configure script, then
execute configure again (or use config.nice instead).

See the PHP documentation for more details on the PHP build process.

=========================================================================
Building PHP with the Ice extension (Windows)
=========================================================================

Compiling PHP from source code on Windows is a tedious process,
therefore we recommend that you download the precompiled dynamic
Ice extension from the ZeroC web site (included in the Ice installer
for Visual C++ 6.0) and use the binary PHP distribution if possible.

If you prefer to build the Ice extension yourself, you must first
understand the C run time dependency issues. Specifically, the Ice
extension must use the same C run time as PHP5. Since the binary
distribution of PHP5 available from php.net depends on the Visual C++
6.0 run time DLL (MSVCRT), you must also build the Ice extension using
Visual C++ 6.0 if you want to use Ice with this PHP distribution. This
is the reason why the precompiled Ice extension is included in the Ice
installer for Visual C++ 6.0, as attempting to use an Ice extension
that was built with a newer compiler together with the binary PHP
distribution results in undefined behavior.

To use a later version of Visual C++, you must obtain (or build) PHP5
with the desired compiler, and use the same compiler to build the Ice
extension.

Follow these instructions to build the Ice extension:

1) Download and extract the PHP5 sources so that the PHP header files
   are available.

2) Download and extract the PHP5 binary distribution for Windows.

3) Have a suitable Ice development environment.

4) Configure the include and library paths in Visual C++ for PHP and
   Ice. Assuming that you've extracted the PHP5 sources into C:\PHP5,
   the binary distribution into C:\PHP5-Win32, and installed Ice into
   C:\Ice, then the following paths must be configured:

   Include:
     C:\PHP5
     C:\PHP5\main
     C:\PHP5\Zend
     C:\PHP5\TSRM
     C:\Ice\include

   Library:
     C:\PHP5-Win32\dev
     C:\Ice\lib

   If you are using Visual C++ 6.0, then you must also be sure to
   include the appropriate paths for STLport.

4) Open the workspace icephp.dsw, select the Debug or Release
   configuration, and build php_ice.dll. Note that the Ice extension
   must be compiled using the same Debug/Release configuration as PHP
   itself. If you are linking against the dynamic libraries included
   in the binary PHP distribution, you must use the Release
   configuration when compiling the Ice extension.


=========================================================================
Installing a Dynamic Extension
=========================================================================

If you are using the dynamic Ice extension, you must move the
extension's shared library into PHP's extension directory. This
directory is determined by the PHP configuration directive
"extension_dir". You can determine the default value for this
directive by running the command-line version of PHP with the -i
option.

After compiling the dynamic extension on Linux and Solaris, the shared
library can be found in the "modules" subdirectory of the PHP source
tree. If you've compiled the dynamic Ice extension on Windows, the
DLL is located in bin/debug/php_ice.dll or bin/release/php_ice.dll,
depending on the build configuration you selected.

Once you've copied the dynamic extension to PHP's extension directory,
you will need to enable the extension in PHP configuration. In php.ini,
use the following directive on Linux and Solaris:

extension = ice.so

On Windows, use this directive:

extension = php_ice.dll


=========================================================================
Dependencies
=========================================================================

Whether you build a dynamic or static Ice extension, PHP will need
to be able to locate the Ice run-time libraries "Ice", "Slice",
"IceUtil" and "bzip2" (Windows) or "libbz2" (Unix). In general, these
libraries must reside in a directory of the user's PATH.

For Web servers, the libraries may need to reside in a system
directory. For example, on Linux you can add the directory containing
the Ice run-time libraries to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig. On
Windows, you can copy the DLLs to the C:\WINDOWS\system32 directory,
or to the Apache installation directory.

You can verify that the Ice extension is installed properly by
examining the output of the "php -m" command, or by calling the
phpinfo() function from a script.

Note that if you want to use IceSSL from the Ice extension, then PHP
will also need access to the shared library for IceSSL.

Finally, the Ice extension will need to execute the Ice preprocessor
(icecpp), therefore this binary must reside in an accessible directory.


=========================================================================
SELinux Notes
=========================================================================

On Fedora Linux and a number of other Linux distributions, SELinux 
augments the traditional Unix permissions with a number of new features. 
In particular, SELinux can prevent the httpd daemon from opening
network connections and reading files without the proper SELinux types.

If you suspect that your IcePHP application does not work due to
SELinux restrictions, we recommend to first try with SELinux disabled.
As root, run:

# setenforce 0

to disable SELinux until the next reboot of your computer.

If you want to run httpd with IcePHP and SELinux enabled, you need to:
 - allow httpd to open network connections:
  # setsebool httpd_can_network_connect=1 
  (use the -P option to make this setting persistent across reboots)
 - make sure any .ice file used by your PHP scripts can be read by 
  httpd. The enclosing directory also needs to be accessible. For
  example:
  # chcon -R -t httpd_sys_content_t /opt/MyApp/slice 

See this FAQ for more information on SELinux:

http://fedora.redhat.com/docs/selinux-faq/


=========================================================================
Running the Tests
=========================================================================

The test subdirectory contains PHP implementations of the core Ice
test suite. In order to run these tests, you must have Python 2.2
or later, and the Ice for C++ tests must be built in the directory
specified by the ICE_HOME environment variable.

The test scripts require that the CLI version of the PHP interpreter
be available in your PATH, and assume that the Ice extension was
built in a static configuration.

To run all of the tests, do the following:

$ python allTests.py

You can also run tests individually by changing to the test directory
and running this command:

$ python run.py

In order to run the tests using a dynamic Ice extension, you will
need to edit the php.ini files in each test directory and add the
following configuration directives:

extension_dir=<phpdir>/modules
extension=ice.so
