======================================================================
Building the Ice for PHP extension (Linux/Mac OS X)
======================================================================

This source distribution only supports building Ice for PHP as a
dynamic PHP extension; the product of the build is a shared library
that you must configure PHP to load.

Follow the steps below to build Ice for PHP:

1. Change to Ice for PHP source subdirectory.

   > cd Ice-@ver@/php

2. Edit config/Make.rules and review the build settings. For example,
   you may want to enable OPTIMIZE. If your PHP installation resides
   in a non-standard location, modify the PHP_HOME setting to contain
   the installation directory. If you are using PHP 5.3 or later and
   wish to use PHP namespaces, set USE_NAMESPACES=yes.

3. If you have not built Ice for C++ from the cpp subdirectory, then
   set the ICE_HOME environment variable to the directory containing 
   your Ice installation. For example, if Ice is installed in
   /opt/Ice-@ver@, set ICE_HOME as follows:

   $ export ICE_HOME=/opt/Ice-@ver@

   If you installed Ice using RPMs, set ICE_HOME as shown below:

   $ export ICE_HOME=/usr

3. Run make.


======================================================================
Building the Ice for PHP extension (Windows)
======================================================================

The Ice installer for Windows includes a precompiled extension for PHP
5.4.8 compiled with Visual Studio 2008 (Visual C++ 9) and compatible
with the "Thread-safe VC9" distribution of PHP available on php.net.
We encourage you to use this extension if possible, together with a
compatible Web server.

Note that the Apache binaries provided by the Apache Software
Foundation are compiled with Visual C++ 6 and therefore are NOT
compatible with the Ice for PHP extension included in our Windows
installer. A VC9 build of Apache is available from alternate sources.

The most common motivation for compiling the Ice extension yourself
is to create an extension that is compatible with your existing
environment, such as when your Web server or PHP interpreter is
built with a different compiler.

To build the Ice extension, follow these instructions:

1) Download the PHP5 binary archive or Windows installer and install
   the distribution.

2) Download and extract the PHP5 sources (Ice for PHP requires the PHP
   header files). If you are using PHP 5.4, change to the PHP5 source
   directory and run the following commands:

   > buildconf
   > configure

   You do not need to actually build PHP from source, but these two
   steps are necessary to generate header files that are required by
   the Ice extension.

3) Open a command window.

4) If you have not built Ice for C++ from the cpp subdirectory then
   you need to set the ICE_HOME environment variable to the location
   of your Ice for C++ installation. For example:

   > set ICE_HOME=C:\Program Files\ZeroC\Ice-@ver@

5) Change to the Ice for PHP source directory.

  > cd Ice-@ver@\php

6) Open config\Make.rules.mak.php, review the comments, and make any
   necessary changes. In particular, you may need to change the values
   of PHP_HOME and PHP_BIN_HOME to refer to your PHP source and binary
   installations, respectively. If you compiled PHP from source, you
   should also review the setting of PHP_LIBDIR. If you are using PHP
   5.3 or later and wish to use PHP namespaces, set
   USE_NAMESPACES=yes. Finally, if you are using a non-thread-safe PHP
   installation, set PHP_ZTS=no.

7) Start NMAKE:

   nmake /f Makefile.mak

8) Upon successful completion, the Ice for PHP extension is created as
   lib\php_ice.dll (Release) or lib\php_iced.dll (Debug).


======================================================================
Installing the Extension (Linux/Mac OS X)
======================================================================

To install the Ice extension, you must move the extension's shared
library into PHP's extension directory. This directory is determined
by the PHP configuration directive "extension_dir". You can determine
the default value for this directive by running the command-line
version of PHP with the -i option:

  php -i

Review the output for a line like this:

  extension_dir => /usr/lib/php/modules => /usr/lib/php/modules

Once you've copied the extension to PHP's extension directory, you
will need to enable the extension in your PHP configuration. Your
PHP installation likely supports the /etc/php.d configuration
directory, which you can verify by examining the output of "php -i"
and looking for the presence of --with-config-file-scan-dir in the
"Configure Command" entry. If present, you can create a file in
/etc/php.d that contains the directive to load the Ice extension.
For example, create the file /etc/php.d/ice.ini containing the
following line on Linux:

  extension = IcePHP.so

Or on Mac OS X:

  extension = IcePHP.dy

If PHP does not support the /etc/php.d directory, determine the path
name of PHP's configuration file as reported by the "php -i" command:

  Configuration File (php.ini) Path => /etc/php.ini

Open the configuration file and append the following line on Linux:

  extension = IcePHP.so

Or on Mac OS X:

  extension = IcePHP.dy

You can verify that PHP is loading the Ice extension by running the
command shown below:

  php -m

Look for "ice" among the installed modules. Note that your library
search path (LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac OS
X) must include the directory containing the Ice shared libraries.

Read the "Dependencies" and "Source Files" sections below for more
information about installing the Ice extension.


======================================================================
Installing the Extension (Windows)
======================================================================

To install the Ice extension, you must move the extension's shared
library into PHP's extension directory. This directory is determined
by the PHP configuration directive "extension_dir". You can determine
the default value for this directive by running the command-line
version of PHP with the -i option:

  php -i

Review the output for a line like this:

  extension_dir => C:\php5 => C:\php5

The directive may also be set to a relative path, such as:

  extension_dir => ./ => ./

In the case of a relative path, the value is relative to the current
working directory of the process. As a result, the working directory
when running the command-line version of PHP will likely differ from
the working directory when PHP is running as a Web server module.
Using a typical installation of Apache as an example, the working
directory is Apache's installation directory, therefore the extension
must be copied to

  \Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2

Once you've copied the extension to the appropriate directory, you
will need to enable the extension in your PHP configuration. First you
must discover the location of PHP's configuration file (php.ini),
which is also displayed by the -i option. Look for the following
line:

  Loaded Configuration File => C:\Program Files\PHP\php.ini

If you used the Windows installer for PHP, your Web server's
configuration may have already been modified to load PHP. You can also
review your Web server's settings to discover the location of php.ini.
For example, PHP's Windows installer modifies Apache's configuration
to add the following directives:

  PHPIniDir "C:/Program Files/PHP/"
  LoadModule php5_module "C:/Program Files/PHP/php5apache2_2.dll"

The PHPIniDir directive specifies the directory containing the php.ini
file.

Open php.ini and append this directive:

  extension = php_ice.dll

Read the "Dependencies" and "Source Files" sections below for more
information about installing the Ice extension.


======================================================================
Dependencies
======================================================================

PHP will need to be able to locate the libraries for the Ice run-time
libraries and its third-party dependencies. On Unix-style platforms,
these libraries are named as follows:

  libIce
  libIceUtil
  libSlice
  libbz2

On Windows, these DLLs are required:

  icevc90_@libver@.dll
  iceutilvc90_@libver@.dll
  slicevc90_@libver@.dll
  bzip2_vc90.dll

In general, these libraries must reside in a directory of the user's
PATH. For Web servers, the libraries may need to reside in a system
directory. For example, on Linux you can add the directory containing
the Ice run-time libraries to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig. On
Windows, you can copy the DLLs to the C:\WINDOWS\system32 directory,
or to the Apache installation directory.

You can verify that the Ice extension is installed properly by
examining the output of the "php -m" command, or by calling the
phpInfo() function from a script. For example, you can create a file
in the Web server's document directory containing the following PHP
script:

  <?php
  phpInfo();
  ?>

Then start a browser window and open the URL corresponding to this
script. If the Ice extension is successfully installed, you will see
an "ice" section among the configuration information.

Note that if you want to use IceSSL from the Ice extension, then PHP
will also need access to the shared libraries for IceSSL and OpenSSL.


======================================================================
Source Files
======================================================================

In addition to the binary Ice extension module and its library
dependencies, you will also need to make the Ice for PHP source files
available to your scripts. These files are located in the "lib"
subdirectory and consist of the Ice run time definitions (Ice.php or
Ice_ns.php) along with PHP source files generated from the Slice files
included in the Ice distribution.

The Ice extension makes no assumptions about the location of these
files, so you can install them anywhere you like. For example, you can
simply include them in the same directory as your application scripts.
Alternatively, if you prefer to install them in a common directory,
you may need to modify PHP's include_path directive so that the PHP
interpreter is able to locate these files. Another option is to modify
the include path from within your script prior to including any Ice
run-time file. Here is an example that assumes Ice is installed in
/opt:

// PHP
ini_set('include_path',
  ini_get('include_path') . PATH_SEPARATOR . '/opt/Ice-@ver@/php');
require 'Ice.php'; // Load the core Ice run time definitions.


======================================================================
Permissions
======================================================================

The Web server normally runs in a special user account that may not
necessarily have access to the Ice extension, its dependent libraries
and PHP source files, and other resources such as Ice configuration
and your application scripts. It is very important that you review the
permissions of these files and verify that the Web server has
sufficient access.

For example, on Windows the Apache server typically runs as a service
in the "Local System" account. You will need to modify the access
rights of the aforementioned files to grant access to this account.
In a command window, you can use the "cacls" utility to establish the
appropriate access rights. Assuming that you have copied the Ice
extension and dependent DLLs to Apache's installation directory, you
can modify the access rights as shown below:

  cd \Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2
  cacls php_ice.dll /G SYSTEM:F Administrators:F
  cacls bzip2.dll /G SYSTEM:F Administrators:F
  ...

On Linux, Apache typically runs in the "apache" account, so you will
either need to change the owner or group of the libraries and other
resources, or modify their permissions to make them sufficiently
accessible.


======================================================================
SELinux Notes
======================================================================

SELinux augments the traditional Unix permissions with a number of
new features. In particular, SELinux can prevent the httpd daemon from
opening network connections and reading files without the proper
SELinux types.

If you suspect that your Ice for PHP application does not work due to
SELinux restrictions, we recommend that you first try it with SELinux
disabled. As root, run:

# setenforce 0

to disable SELinux until the next reboot of your computer.

If you want to run httpd with Ice for PHP and SELinux enabled, you must
do the following:

- Allow httpd to open network connections:

  # setsebool httpd_can_network_connect=1 

  (add the -P option to make this setting persistent across reboots)

- Make sure any .ice file used by your PHP scripts can be read by 
  httpd. The enclosing directory also needs to be accessible. For
  example:

  # chcon -R -t httpd_sys_content_t /opt/MyApp/slice 

For more information on SELinux in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, refer to
the link below:

======================================================================
Running the Tests
======================================================================

The test subdirectory contains PHP implementations of the core Ice
test suite. Python is required to run the test suite:

  http://www.python.org/download

The test suites require that the Ice for C++ tests be built in the
cpp subdirectory of this source distribution. In addition, the scripts
require that the CLI version of the PHP interpreter be available in
your PATH.

To run all of the tests, do the following:

  > python allTests.py

You can also run tests individually by changing to the test directory
and running this command:

  > python run.py

If everything worked out, you should see lots of "ok" messages. In
case of a failure, the tests abort with "failed".
