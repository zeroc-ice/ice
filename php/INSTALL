- PHP 5.0.3 (http://www.php.net/downloads.php)
- Ice 2.1.0



=========================================================================
Building PHP with the Ice extension (Linux/Solaris/HP-UX/MacOS X/AIX)
=========================================================================

PHP's build system can create several versions of the PHP interpreter.
There are the command-line interface (CLI) and Common Gateway
Interface (CGI) interpreters, both of which are standalone
executables. In addition, the build system can package the interpreter
as a shared library for use as a Web server module.

To further complicate matters, PHP extensions can be either static or
dynamic. A static extension is compiled into the interpreter, whereas
a dynamic extension is created as a standalone shared library that is
installed in PHP via configuration directives.

The Ice extension for PHP supports both static and dynamic
configurations. The only supported way to compile the Ice extension
is as part of the larger PHP build process. Unfortunately, PHP's build
system does not completely accommodate extensions written in C++,
therefore some manual intervention is required.

Adding the Ice extension
------------------------

After downloading and extracting the PHP5 source code, you must
incorporate the Ice extension sources into the PHP5 source tree.
There are two ways to do this:

1) Copy the extension source directory.

   $ cd <icephpdir>
   $ cp -r src/ice <phpdir>/ext

2) Create a symbolic link to the extension:

   $ cd <phpdir>
   $ ln -s <icephpdir>/src/ice ext

Updating configure
------------------

In order to make the PHP build system aware of the Ice extension, the
configure script must be updated. If you have the necessary tools
installed on your system (e.g., autoconf, etc.), you can regenerate
the script using the following commands:

$ cd <phpdir>
$ rm -rf configure autom4te.cache
$ ./buildconf --force

Alternatively, you can use the configure script supplied in the IcePHP
source distribution:

$ cd <phpdir>
$ cp <icephpdir>/configure.gz .
$ gunzip configure

Running configure
-----------------

Set the CC and CXX environment variables to the names of your C and
C++ compilers, respectively.

You are now ready to configure PHP. To include support for a static
Ice extension, use the --with-ice option to specify the location of
the Ice installation:

$ ./configure --with-ice=$ICE_HOME ...

If you want to build a dynamic Ice extension, use this version of the
--with-ice option:

$ ./configure --with-ice=shared,$ICE_HOME ...

Note that additional configuration options may be generally necessary.
Please refer to the PHP documentation for more information.

Source patches
--------------

No source patches are necessary to compile PHP 5.0.0 on the supported
platforms.

Platform-specific Issues
------------------------

Please refer to the relevant section for your platform below before
proceeding any further.

Build PHP
---------

Finally, run make:

$ make

Note that if the Ice extension's config.m4 file is changed, then you
must repeat the steps above to regenerate the configure script, then
execute configure again (or use config.nice instead).

See the PHP documentation for more details on the PHP build process.



=========================================================================
Additional Requirements for Linux with GCC
=========================================================================

No additional steps are necessary on Linux.



=========================================================================
Additional Requirements for Solaris with Sun CC
=========================================================================

1. Edit the file <phpdir>/libtool, search for the line beginning with
   "archive_cmds=", and change \$LD to \$CXX in the value of both
   archive_cmds and archive_expsym_cmds.

2. If you are building the Ice extension in a dynamic configuration, edit
   the file <phpdir>/Makefile and add the following definition:

     EXTRA_CXXFLAGS = -DCOMPILE_DL_ICE

     definition of the BUILD_CLI variable and change "$(CC)" to "$(CXX)".

   - If the CGI interpreter is being built, search for the definition of
     the BUILD_CGI variable and change "$(CC)" to "$(CXX)".

   - If a Web server module is being built, search for the line beginning
     with "libphp5.la:", and change "$(CC)" to "$(CXX)" in that rule, as
     well as in the rule for "libs/libphp5.bundle" below.

Note that PHP 5 cannot be compiled using Sun CC 5.3.

    well as in the rule for "libs/libphp5.bundle" below.




=========================================================================
Building PHP with the Ice extension (Windows)
=========================================================================

Compiling PHP from source code on Windows is a tedious process,
therefore we recommend that you download the precompiled dynamic
extension for Ice from the ZeroC web site and use the binary PHP
distribution if possible.

If you prefer to build the dynamic extension yourself, you will need
to do the following:

1) Download and extract the PHP5 sources so that the PHP header files
   are available.

2) Download and extract the PHP5 binary distribution for Windows.

3) Have a suitable Ice development environment.

4) Configure the include and library paths in Visual C++ for PHP and
   Ice. Assuming that you've extracted the PHP5 sources into C:\PHP5,
   the binary distribution into C:\PHP5-Win32, and installed Ice into
   C:\Ice, then the following paths must be configured:

   Include:
     C:\PHP5
     C:\PHP5\main
     C:\PHP5\Zend
     C:\PHP5\TSRM
     C:\Ice\include

   Library:
     C:\PHP5-Win32
     C:\PHP5-Win32\dev
     C:\Ice\lib

   If you are using Visual C++ 6.0, then you must also be sure to
   include the appropriate paths for STLport.

4) Open the workspace icephp.dsw, select the Debug or Release
   configuration, and build php_ice.dll. Note that the Ice extension
   must be compiled using the same Debug/Release configuration as PHP
   itself. If you are linking against the dynamic libraries included
   in the binary PHP distribution, you must use the Release
   configuration when compiling the Ice extension.

NOTE: The Ice extension for PHP does not work correctly with Apache2
      when compiled with Visual C++ 6.0 due to a problem in the run
      time library. If you need to use Ice with Apache2, you must
      use a version compiled with Visual C++ .NET (2002 or later).


=========================================================================
Installing a Dynamic Extension
=========================================================================

If you are using the dynamic Ice extension, you must move the
extension's shared library into PHP's extension directory. This
directory is determined by the PHP configuration directive
"extension_dir". You can determine the default value for this
directive by running the command-line version of PHP with the -i
option.

After compiling the dynamic extension on Linux and Solaris, the shared
library can be found in the "modules" subdirectory of the PHP source
tree. If you've compiled the dynamic Ice extension on Windows, the
DLL is located in bin/debug/php_ice.dll or bin/release/php_ice.dll,
depending on the build configuration you selected.

Once you've copied the dynamic extension to PHP's extension directory,
you will need to enable the extension in PHP configuration. In php.ini,
use the following directive on Linux and Solaris:

extension = ice.so

On Windows, use this directive:

extension = php_ice.dll



=========================================================================
Dependencies
=========================================================================

Whether you build a dynamic or static Ice extension, PHP will need
to be able to locate the Ice run-time libraries "Ice", "Slice" and
"IceUtil". In general, these libraries must reside in a directory of
the user's PATH.

For Web servers, the libraries may need to reside in a system
directory. For example, on Linux you can add the directory containing
the Ice run-time libraries to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig. On
Windows, you can copy the DLLs to the C:\WINDOWS\system32 directory.

You can verify that the Ice extension is installed properly by
examining the output of the "php -m" command, or by calling the
phpinfo() function from a script.

Note that if you want to use IceSSL from the Ice extension, then PHP
will also need access to the shared libraries for IceSSL and Xerces.

Finally, the Ice extension will need to execute the Ice preprocessor
(icecpp), therefore this binary must reside in an accessible directory.



=========================================================================
Running the Tests
=========================================================================

The test subdirectory contains PHP implementations of the core Ice
test suite. In order to run these tests, you must have Python 2.2
or later, and the Ice for C++ tests must be built in the directory
specified by the ICE_HOME environment variable.

The test scripts require that the CLI version of the PHP interpreter
be available in your PATH, and assume that the Ice extension was
built in a static configuration.

To run all of the tests, do the following:

$ python allTests.py

You can also run tests individually by changing to the test directory
and running this command:

$ python run.py

In order to run the tests using a dynamic Ice extension, you will
need to edit the php.ini files in each test directory and add the
following configuration directives:

extension_dir=<phpdir>/modules
extension=ice.so
